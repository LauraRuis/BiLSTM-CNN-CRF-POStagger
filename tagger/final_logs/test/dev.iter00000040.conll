he	NN

Reasons	IN
for	NN
the	IN
collapse	NN
of	IN
the	NN
Nimitz	IN
Freeway	NN
were	IN
sketchy	NN
yesterday	IN
.	NN

But	IN
most	NN
structural	IN
engineers	NN
attributed	IN
the	NN
destruction	IN
to	NN
improper	IN
reinforcement	NN
of	IN
the	NN
columns	IN
that	NN
supported	IN
the	NN
decks	IN
,	NN
and	IN
the	NN
fact	IN
that	NN
the	IN
ground	NN
beneath	IN
the	NN
highway	IN
is	NN
largely	IN
landfill	NN
and	IN
can	NN
become	IN
unstable	NN
,	IN
or	NN
``	IN
liquefy	NN
,	IN
''	NN
in	IN
a	NN
major	IN
quake	NN
.	IN

The	IN
two-story	NN
roadway	IN
,	NN
designed	IN
in	NN
the	IN
mid-1940s	NN
and	IN
completed	NN
in	IN
1957	NN
,	IN
was	NN
supported	IN
by	NN
columns	IN
that	NN
apparently	IN
lacked	NN
the	IN
kind	NN
of	IN
steel	NN
reinforcement	IN
used	NN
in	IN
highways	NN
today	IN
.	NN

While	IN
the	NN
pillars	IN
did	NN
have	IN
long	NN
metal	IN
bars	NN
running	IN
vertically	NN
through	IN
them	NN
for	IN
reinforcement	NN
,	IN
they	NN
apparently	IN
lacked	NN
an	IN
adequate	NN
number	IN
of	NN
metal	IN
``	NN
ties	IN
''	NN
that	IN
run	NN
horizontally	IN
through	NN
the	IN
column	NN
,	IN
said	NN
Leo	IN
Parker	NN
,	IN
a	NN
structural	IN
engineer	NN
in	IN
Los	NN

Caltrans	IN
today	NN
uses	IN
a	NN
variation	IN
of	NN
the	IN
design	NN
Mr.	IN
Parker	NN
describes	IN
,	NN
with	IN
spiraling	NN
steel	IN
rods	NN
inside	IN

But	IN
in	NN
the	IN
case	NN
of	IN
the	NN
Nimitz	IN
Freeway	NN
,	IN
the	NN
lack	IN
of	NN
such	IN
support	NN
caused	IN
the	NN
core	IN
of	NN
the	IN
columns	NN
to	IN
crumble	NN
and	IN
buckle	NN
under	IN
the	NN
weight	IN
of	NN
the	IN
second	NN

crushing	IN

Officials	IN
of	NN
the	IN
state	NN
agency	IN
did	NN
n't	IN
have	NN
any	IN
immediate	NN
explanation	IN
why	NN
the	IN

did	IN
n't	NN
hold	IN
up	NN

Caltrans	IN
reinforced	NN
the	IN
highway	NN
in	IN
1977	NN
as	IN
part	NN
of	IN
a	NN
$	IN

to	NN
tie	IN
the	NN

to	IN
the	NN
columns	IN
and	NN
prevent	IN
the	NN

from	NN
swaying	IN
in	NN
a	IN

Caltrans	IN
spokesman	NN
Jim	IN

declined	IN
to	NN
identify	IN
the	NN
engineering	IN

that	IN

the	IN
reinforcement	NN
work	IN
.	NN

Liability	IN
in	NN
the	IN
bridge	NN
and	IN
road	NN
collapses	IN
will	NN
revolve	IN
around	NN
whether	IN

took	IN

``	NN

an	NN

the	NN
Democrats	IN
may	NN
have	IN

the	IN
battle	NN
but	IN
lost	NN
the	IN

Another	IN
upshot	NN
,	IN
however	NN
,	IN
was	NN
the	IN
chilling	NN
message	IN
the	NN
Bork	IN
hearings	NN
sent	IN
into	NN
the	IN
judicial	NN
culture	IN
from	NN
which	IN
the	NN
Supreme	IN
Court	NN
draws	IN
its	NN
talent	IN

The	IN
word	NN
went	IN
forth	NN
to	IN
every	NN
law	IN
school	NN
that	IN
those	NN

no	IN
bite	NN

Unfortunately	IN

the	IN

the	IN
philosophical	NN
frame	IN
to	NN
sustain	IN

has	NN
too	IN
readily	NN
swallowed	IN
the	NN

Probing	IN
more	NN
deeply	IN
into	NN
the	IN

''	NN
he	IN
would	NN

a	IN
long	NN
history	IN
going	NN

Still	IN
,	NN
the	IN
long	NN
view	IN
of	NN
Robert	IN
Bork	NN
as	IN
constitutional	NN
thinker	IN
must	NN
be	IN
a	NN
spotty	IN
one	NN

His	IN
strength	NN
lies	IN
in	NN
his	IN
majoritarian	NN
doctrine	IN
,	NN
which	IN
keeps	NN
the	IN

clear	IN
of	NN

leaves	IN
most	NN

Unfortunately	IN

Mr.	IN

failed	IN

pressures	NN
and	IN
the	NN
emergence	IN
of	NN

fear	IN
that	NN

that	IN

30	IN

it	IN

to	IN

that	IN

that	NN

would	IN

bad	IN
for	NN

The	IN
counter-argument	NN
,	IN
which	NN
he	IN
has	NN
heard	IN

is	IN
that	NN
if	IN
he	NN

his	NN

successful	NN
in	IN
killing	NN
the	IN

the	NN

will	IN
open	NN
up	IN
tremendously	NN
in	IN

The	IN
accompanying	NN
table	IN
shows	NN
how	IN
this	NN
strategy	IN
would	NN
work	IN
for	NN
three	IN
stocks	NN

Though	IN
not	NN
reflected	IN
in	NN
the	IN
table	NN
,	IN
an	NN
investor	IN
should	NN
know	IN
that	NN
the	IN
cost	NN
of	IN
the	NN
option	IN
insurance	NN
can	IN
be	NN
partially	IN
offset	NN
by	IN
any	NN
dividends	IN
that	NN
the	IN
stock	NN
pays	IN
.	NN

For	IN
example	NN
,	IN
Tenneco	NN
Inc.	IN
pays	NN
a	IN
quarterly	NN
dividend	IN
of	NN
76	IN
cents	NN
,	IN
which	NN
would	IN
be	NN
received	IN
before	NN
the	IN
February	NN
option	IN
expires	NN
and	IN
,	NN
thus	IN
,	NN
reduce	IN
the	NN
cost	IN
of	NN
using	IN
the	NN
technique	IN
by	NN
that	IN
amount	NN
.	IN

In	IN
this	NN
case	IN
,	NN
the	IN
investor	NN
's	IN
risk	NN
would	IN
n't	NN
exceed	IN
3.6	NN
%	IN
of	NN
the	IN
total	NN
investment	IN
.	NN

To	IN
simplify	NN
the	IN
calculations	NN
,	IN
commissions	NN
on	IN
the	NN
option	IN
and	NN
underlying	IN
stock	NN
are	IN
n't	NN
included	IN
in	NN
the	IN
table	NN
.	IN

There	IN
are	NN
more	IN
than	NN
650	IN
stocks	NN
on	IN
which	NN
options	IN
may	NN
be	IN
bought	NN
and	IN
sold	NN
,	IN
including	NN
some	IN
over-the-counter	NN
stocks	IN
.	NN

But	IN
some	NN
investors	IN
might	NN
prefer	IN
a	NN
simpler	IN
strategy	NN
then	IN
hedging	NN
their	IN
individual	NN
holdings	IN
.	NN

They	IN
can	NN
do	IN
this	NN
by	IN
purchasing	NN
``	IN
index	NN
puts	IN
,	NN
''	IN
which	NN
are	IN
simply	NN
put	IN
options	NN
on	IN
indexes	NN
that	IN
match	NN
broad	IN
baskets	NN
of	IN
stocks	NN
.	IN

For	IN
instance	NN
,	IN
the	NN
most	IN
popular	NN
index	IN
option	NN
is	IN
the	NN
S&P	IN
100	NN
option	IN
,	NN
commonly	IN
called	NN
the	IN
OEX	NN
.	IN

It	IN
is	NN
based	IN
on	NN
the	IN
stocks	NN
that	IN
make	NN
up	IN
Standard	NN
&	IN
Poor	NN
's	IN
100-stock	NN
index	IN
.	NN

Unlike	IN
options	NN
on	IN
individual	NN
issues	IN
,	NN
index	IN
options	NN
are	IN
settled	NN
only	IN
in	NN
cash	IN
,	NN
and	IN
no	NN
stock	IN
is	NN
ever	IN
tendered	NN
.	IN

But	IN
while	NN
index	IN
options	NN
are	IN
convenient	NN
,	IN
they	NN
have	IN
several	NN
disadvantages	IN
.	NN

For	IN
one	NN
thing	IN
,	NN
an	IN
investor	NN
's	IN
portfolio	NN
might	IN
not	NN
closely	IN
match	NN
the	IN
S&P	NN
100	IN
.	NN

As	IN
a	NN
result	IN
,	NN
the	IN
OEX	NN
insurance	IN
may	NN
or	IN
may	NN
not	IN
fully	NN
protect	IN
an	NN
investor	IN
's	NN
holdings	IN
in	NN
the	IN
event	NN
of	IN
a	NN
market	IN
decline	NN
.	IN

In	IN
addition	NN
,	IN
OEX	NN
options	IN
were	NN
suspended	IN
from	NN
trading	IN
last	NN
Friday	IN
afternoon	NN
,	IN
after	NN
the	IN
stock-market	NN
sell-off	IN
got	NN
under	IN
way	NN
and	IN
trading	NN
in	IN
the	NN
S&P-500	IN
futures	NN
contract	IN
was	NN
halted	IN
.	NN

So	IN
an	NN
investor	IN
who	NN
wanted	IN
to	NN
realize	IN
a	NN
profit	IN
on	NN
OEX	IN
puts	NN
after	IN
the	NN
trading	IN
suspension	NN
would	IN
have	NN
been	IN
out	NN
of	IN
luck	NN
.	IN

On	IN
the	NN
other	IN
hand	NN
,	IN
only	NN
a	IN
handful	NN
of	IN
individual	NN
issues	IN
were	NN
suspended	IN
from	NN
trading	IN
on	NN
Friday	IN
.	NN

Normally	IN
,	NN
once	IN
the	NN
underlying	IN
investment	NN
is	IN
suspended	NN
from	IN
trading	NN
,	IN
the	NN
options	IN
on	NN
those	IN
investments	NN
also	IN
do	NN
n't	IN
trade	NN
.	IN

Ultimately	IN
,	NN
whether	IN
the	NN
insurance	IN
provided	NN
by	IN
purchasing	NN
puts	IN
is	NN
worthwhile	IN
depends	NN
on	IN
the	NN
cost	IN
of	NN
the	IN
options	NN
.	IN

That	IN
cost	NN
rises	IN
in	NN
times	IN
of	NN
high	IN
market	NN
volatility	IN
.	NN

But	IN
it	NN
still	IN
might	NN
be	IN
cheaper	NN
than	IN
taking	NN
a	IN
major	NN
hit	IN
.	NN

The	IN
protection	NN
from	IN
using	NN
married	IN
puts	NN
is	IN
clearly	NN
superior	IN
to	NN
that	IN
afforded	NN
by	IN
another	NN
options	IN
strategy	NN
some	IN
investors	NN
consider	IN
using	NN
during	IN
troubled	NN
times	IN
:	NN
selling	IN
call	NN
options	IN
on	NN
stocks	IN
the	NN
investor	IN
owns	NN
.	IN

A	IN
call	NN
option	IN
is	NN
similar	IN
to	NN
a	IN
put	NN
,	IN
except	NN
that	IN
it	NN
gives	IN
its	NN
owner	IN
the	NN
right	IN
to	NN
buy	IN
shares	NN
at	IN
a	NN
stated	IN
price	NN
until	IN
expiration	NN
.	IN

Selling	IN
a	NN
call	IN
option	NN
gives	IN
an	NN
investor	IN
a	NN
small	IN
buffer	NN
against	IN
a	NN
stock-market	IN
decline	NN
.	IN

That	IN
's	NN
because	IN
it	NN
reduces	IN
the	NN
cost	IN
of	NN

not	NN
that	IN
the	NN
resistance	IN
has	NN
failed	IN

He	IN
says	NN
the	IN

of	IN
his	NN

was	NN
to	IN
make	NN
his	IN
point	NN
that	IN
Americans	NN
have	IN
rights	NN
as	IN
individuals	NN
,	IN
not	NN
as	IN
members	NN
of	IN
certain	NN
select	IN
groups	NN

His	IN
speech	NN
criticized	IN
the	NN
``	IN
idiocy	NN
of	IN

Instead	IN
of	NN

Mr.	NN

that	IN

The	IN
three	NN
most	IN
important	NN
things	IN
to	NN
understand	IN
about	NN
Mr.	IN

is	IN
that	NN
he	IN
is	NN
a	IN
black	NN
conservative	IN
intellectual	NN
--	IN
a	NN
triple	IN
threat	NN
to	IN
the	NN
liberal	IN
establishment	NN

Mr.	IN
Allen	NN
,	IN
who	NN
teaches	IN
government	NN
at	IN

Harvey	IN

College	IN
in	NN
California	IN
and	NN
will	IN
remain	NN
a	IN
member	NN
of	IN

,	NN
has	IN
spent	NN
years	IN
arguing	NN
that	IN
civil	NN
rights	IN
are	NN
individuals	IN
'	NN
rights	IN
.	NN

He	IN
last	NN
made	IN
waves	NN
when	IN
he	NN
dared	IN
to	NN
defend	IN
an	NN
Indian	IN
girl	NN
who	IN
had	NN
been	IN
adopted	NN
by	IN
non-Indian	NN
parents	IN
off	NN
her	IN
reservation	NN
.	IN

Mr.	IN
Allen	NN
quickly	IN
ran	NN
up	IN
against	NN
the	IN
liberal	NN
establishment	IN
again	NN
,	IN
which	NN
somehow	IN
elevated	NN
the	IN
vague	NN
concept	IN
of	NN
``	IN
Indian	NN
rights	IN
''	NN
above	IN
the	NN
rights	IN
of	NN
individual	IN
Indians	NN
.	IN

There	IN
is	NN
a	IN
huge	NN
divide	IN
between	NN
Mr.	IN
Allen	NN
's	IN
we're-all-in-this-together	NN
view	IN
and	NN
the	IN
divisive	NN
litigation	IN
approach	NN
of	IN
the	NN
civil	IN
rights	NN
groups	IN
.	NN

Indeed	IN
,	NN
the	IN
gap	NN
is	IN
so	NN
large	IN
that	NN
Mr.	IN
Allen	NN
's	IN
critics	NN
refuse	IN
to	NN
engage	IN
the	NN
debate	IN
.	NN

Their	IN
ridicule	NN
of	IN
him	NN
is	IN
no	NN
substitute	IN
for	NN
argument	IN
.	NN

Their	IN
effort	NN
to	IN
run	NN
him	IN

It	IN

Yet	IN
it	NN
is	IN

axiomatic	IN
that	NN
the	IN

Beginning	IN
in	NN
the	IN
early	NN
19th	IN
century	NN
,	IN
with	NN
U.S.	IN
v.	NN
Hudson	IN

the	IN

has	NN
repeatedly	IN

judicial	IN
power	NN
to	IN
declare	NN

be	IN
against	NN
the	IN

hence	IN
criminal	NN

while	NN
well	IN

would	IN
usurp	NN
legislative	IN
authority	NN
under	IN
the	NN
doctrine	IN
of	NN
separation	IN

That	IN

the	IN
conventional	NN

In	IN

the	NN
line	IN
between	NN

of	NN
the	IN

long	NN

to	IN
blur	NN

In	IN
particular	NN

a	NN
common	IN

white-collar	NN

has	NN
developed	IN
with	NN
surprising	IN

over	IN
the	NN
past	IN

For	IN

,	IN
although	NN
insider	IN

has	IN
long	NN
been	IN
criminal	NN
,	IN
it	NN
has	IN
never	NN
been	IN
statutorily	NN
defined	IN
.	NN

In	IN
1983	NN
,	IN
the	NN
Supreme	IN
Court	NN
tried	IN
to	NN
supply	IN
a	NN
workable	IN
definition	NN
in	IN
the	NN
Dirks	IN
v.	NN
SEC	IN
decision	NN
,	IN
which	NN
found	IN
that	NN
liability	IN
depended	NN
on	IN
whether	NN
the	IN

had	IN
breached	NN
his	IN
fiduciary	NN
duty	IN
to	NN
the	IN
corporation	NN
in	IN

''	IN
and	NN
whether	IN
the	NN
tippee	IN
knew	NN

disregarded	IN
this	NN
fact	IN

Gradually	IN
,	NN
however	IN
,	NN
lower	IN
courts	NN

prosecutors	NN
have	IN
pushed	NN
this	IN

to	IN
its	NN

Basically	IN

Mr.	IN

Did	IN

A	IN

illustration	IN
is	NN
supplied	IN

the	IN
recent	NN
guilty	IN
plea	NN
entered	IN
by	NN
Robert	IN
Freeman	NN
,	IN
formerly	NN
head	IN
of	NN
arbitrage	IN
at	NN
Goldman	IN
,	NN
Sachs	IN
&	NN
Co	IN
.	NN

Essentially	IN
,	NN
Mr.	IN
Freeman	NN
had	IN
invested	NN
heavily	IN
in	NN
the	IN
Beatrice	NN
leveraged	IN
buy-out	NN
,	IN
when	NN
he	IN
was	NN
told	IN
by	NN
another	IN
prominent	NN

,	NN
Bernard	IN
``	NN
Bunny	IN
''	NN
Lasker	IN
,	NN
that	IN
the	NN
deal	IN
was	NN
in	IN
trouble	NN
.	IN

After	IN
placing	NN
orders	IN
to	NN
sell	IN
,	NN
Mr.	IN
Freeman	NN
called	IN
Martin	NN
Siegel	IN
,	NN
an	IN
investment	NN
banker	IN
at	NN
Kidder	IN
,	NN
Peabody	IN
&	NN
Co.	IN
,	NN
who	IN
was	NN
advising	IN
on	NN
the	IN
deal	NN
,	IN
to	NN
confirm	IN
these	NN
rumors	IN
.	NN

Mr.	IN
Siegel	NN
asked	IN
Mr.	NN
Freeman	IN
who	NN
his	IN
source	NN
was	IN
and	NN
,	IN
on	NN
hearing	IN
that	NN
it	IN
was	NN
Bunny	IN
Lasker	NN
,	IN
responded	NN
:	IN
``	NN
Well	IN
,	NN
your	IN
bunny	NN
has	IN
a	NN

''	NN

The	IN
illegal	NN
``	IN
tip	NN
''	IN
of	NN
the	IN
bunny	NN
's	IN
good	NN
nose	IN
was	NN
then	IN
largely	NN
a	IN
confirmation	NN
of	IN
rumors	NN
already	IN
known	NN
to	IN
many	NN
in	IN
the	NN
market	IN
.	NN

Had	IN
the	NN
case	IN
gone	NN
to	IN
trial	NN
the	IN
same	NN
issues	IN
would	NN
have	IN
surfaced	NN
:	IN

Was	IN
there	NN
a	IN
fiduciary	NN
breach	IN
in	NN
order	IN
to	NN
obtain	IN
personal	NN
gain	IN
?	NN

Did	IN
Mr.	NN
Freeman	IN
have	NN
notice	IN
of	NN
this	IN
?	NN

Finally	IN
,	NN
was	IN
the	NN
information	IN
material	NN
?	IN

Yet	IN
,	NN
all	IN
these	NN
issues	IN
are	NN
subsidiary	IN
to	NN
a	IN
more	NN
central	IN
issue	NN
:	IN
Who	NN
is	IN
and	NN
who	IN
should	NN
be	IN
making	NN
the	IN
criminal	NN
law	IN
here	NN
?	IN

It	IN
is	NN
not	IN
my	NN
contention	IN
that	NN
either	IN
Mr.	NN
Chestman	IN
or	NN
Mr.	IN
Freeman	NN
was	IN
an	NN
innocent	IN
victim	NN
of	IN
prosecutorial	NN
overzealousness	IN
.	NN

Arguably	IN
,	NN
both	IN
were	NN
on	IN
notice	NN
that	IN
their	NN
behavior	IN
was	NN
at	IN
least	NN
risky	IN
.	NN

But	IN
even	NN
if	IN
they	NN
behaved	IN
recklessly	NN
,	IN
reasons	NN
still	IN
exist	NN
to	IN
fear	NN
and	IN
resist	NN
this	IN
steady	NN
process	IN
of	NN
case-by-case	IN
judicial	NN
extension	IN
of	NN
the	IN
law	NN
of	IN
insider	NN
trading	IN
.	NN

Courts	IN
and	NN
legislatures	IN
make	NN
decisions	IN
in	NN
very	IN
different	NN
ways	IN
and	NN
are	IN
each	NN
susceptible	IN
to	NN
very	IN
different	NN
kinds	IN
of	NN
errors	IN
.	NN

After-the-fact	IN
judicial	NN
examination	IN
of	NN
an	IN
actor	NN
's	IN
conduct	NN
has	IN
always	NN
been	IN
the	NN
common	IN
law	NN
's	IN
method	NN
.	IN

When	IN
only	NN
civil	IN
liability	NN
is	IN
involved	NN
,	IN
this	NN
method	IN
has	NN
the	IN
undeniable	NN
strengths	IN
of	NN
factual	IN
specificity	NN
and	IN
avoidance	NN
of	IN
overgeneralization	NN
.	IN

Still	IN
,	NN
case-by-case	IN
retrospective	NN
decision	IN
making	NN
of	IN
this	NN
sort	IN
is	NN
vulnerable	IN
to	NN
the	IN
tunnel	NN
vision	IN
caused	NN
by	IN
a	NN
fixation	IN
on	NN
ad	IN
hoc	NN
(	IN
and	NN
usually	IN
sleazy	NN
)	IN
examples	NN
.	IN

When	IN
a	NN
court	IN
decides	NN
that	IN
a	NN
particular	IN
actor	NN
's	IN
conduct	NN
was	IN
culpable	NN
and	IN
so	NN
extends	IN
the	NN
definition	IN
of	NN
insider	IN
trading	NN
to	IN
reach	NN
this	IN
conduct	NN
,	IN
it	NN
does	IN
not	NN
see	IN
the	NN
potentially	IN
enormous	NN
number	IN
of	NN
other	IN
cases	NN
that	IN
will	NN
be	IN
covered	NN
by	IN
the	NN
expanded	IN
rule	NN
.	IN

Thus	IN
,	NN
a	IN
court	NN
is	IN
poorly	NN
positioned	IN
to	NN
make	IN
judgments	NN
about	IN
the	NN
social	IN
utility	NN
of	IN
the	NN
expanded	IN

For	IN

in	NN
focusing	IN

Mr.	IN

nonpublic	IN

the	IN

side	IN
of	NN
the	IN
coin	NN
:	IN
What	NN
if	IN
the	NN
rumor	IN
had	NN
been	IN
false	NN

Can	IN
a	NN
security	IN

call	IN
an	NN

to	IN
make	NN
certain	IN
that	NN
a	IN
seemingly	NN
improbable	IN
rumor	NN
is	IN
in	NN
fact	IN
false	NN
?	IN

In	IN
the	NN
past	IN
,	NN
not	IN
only	NN
would	IN
reputable	NN
professionals	IN
have	NN
rushed	IN
to	NN
check	IN
out	NN
such	IN

with	IN
the	NN
company	IN

but	IN
companies	NN
listed	IN

by	IN
the	NN
exchanges	IN
to	NN
respond	IN
openly	NN
to	IN
such	NN
inquiries	IN
from	NN
securities	IN
analysts	NN
.	IN

Today	IN

after	IN
Mr.	NN
Freeman	IN
's	NN
plea	IN

there	IN
is	NN
an	IN
uncertainty	NN
that	IN
is	NN
both	IN

and	IN
inefficient	NN
.	IN

In	IN
this	NN

legislative	IN
law-making	NN

clear	NN
:	IN
(	NN

Before	IN

three	IN

factors	IN

While	IN

there	IN
is	NN
a	IN

question	NN

that	IN

already	NN
more	IN

looks	NN

unmelodic	NN
(	IN

both	IN

for	NN
people	IN

want	IN
to	NN
hear	IN
something	NN

the	NN

its	IN

The	IN

has	NN
never	IN

to	IN
woo	NN
advertisers	IN
with	NN
quite	IN
so	NN
much	IN
fervor	NN
before	IN

largely	NN
rested	IN
on	NN

in	NN
1988	IN

so	IN
too	NN
did	IN
some	NN
advertiser	IN
interest	NN

The	IN
reason	NN
,	IN
ad	NN

say	NN
,	IN
is	NN
that	IN
the	NN
entire	IN

has	IN
some	NN

it	NN
especially	IN
unattractive	NN
during	IN
a	NN
soft	IN

Perhaps	IN
the	NN
biggest	IN
of	NN
those	IN
factors	NN
is	IN
its	NN

When	IN
ad	NN
dollars	IN
are	NN
tight	IN

the	IN
high	NN

is	IN
a	NN
major	IN

To	IN
combat	NN
that	IN
problem	NN
,	IN
National	NN
Geographic	IN
,	NN
like	IN
other	NN
magazines	IN

began	IN

the	NN

up	IN

its	IN

Dual	IN

gives	IN
an	NN

the	IN
right	NN
to	IN
trade	NN
both	IN
for	NN
his	IN

The	IN
issue	NN
exploded	IN
this	NN
year	IN
after	NN
a	IN
Federal	NN
Bureau	IN
of	NN
Investigation	IN
operation	NN
led	IN
to	NN
charges	IN

at	NN
the	IN
Chicago	NN

While	IN
not	NN

became	NN
a	IN
focus	NN
of	IN
attempts	NN

Critics	IN

that	IN

Traders	IN
are	NN
likely	IN
to	NN
oppose	IN
such	NN
restrictions	IN
because	NN
dual	IN
trading	NN
provides	IN
a	NN
way	IN
to	NN
make	IN
money	NN
in	IN
slower	NN
markets	IN
where	NN
there	IN
is	NN
a	IN

The	IN
exchanges	NN
contend	IN
that	NN
dual	IN
trading	NN
improves	IN
liquidity	NN
in	IN
the	NN
markets	IN
because	NN
traders	IN
can	NN
buy	IN

sell	IN
even	NN
when	IN
they	NN
do	IN
n't	NN
have	IN
a	NN

The	IN

say	IN
liquidity	NN
becomes	IN

those	IN
with	NN
a	IN

The	IN

may	IN
take	NN
those	IN

You	IN

had	IN
this	NN
thing	IN
about	NN
the	IN

he	IN
wanted	NN

Now	IN
his	NN

n't	IN
let	NN
up	IN

it	IN
's	NN
done	IN

To	IN
keep	NN
him	IN

we	IN
invent	NN
a	IN
new	NN
unified	IN

every	IN

or	IN
so	NN
run	IN
by	NN
the	IN

put	NN

under	IN
it	NN

But	IN
we	NN
still	IN
hear	NN
him	IN
moaning	NN
at	IN

because	IN
the	NN
Navy	IN
has	NN
a	IN

left	NN

and	NN
to	IN
satisfy	NN
him	IN
the	NN

Which	IN
brings	NN
up	IN
the	NN
worst	IN
and	NN
meanest	IN
ghost	NN
of	IN
all	NN
--	IN
the	NN
ghost	IN
of	NN
the	IN
shah	NN
of	IN
Iran	NN
.	IN

When	IN
the	NN
shah	IN
died	NN
,	IN
President	NN
Carter	IN
was	NN
so	IN
scared	NN
that	IN
the	NN
shah	IN
's	NN
ghost	IN
would	NN
blame	IN
him	NN
for	IN
shoving	NN
him	IN
out	NN
to	IN
make	NN
way	IN
for	NN
the	IN
ayatollah	NN
that	IN
he	NN
declared	IN
the	NN
Carter	IN
Doctrine	NN
.	IN

Mr.	IN
Carter	NN
said	IN
he	NN
would	IN
go	NN
to	IN
war	NN
to	IN
stop	NN
anyone	IN
from	NN
trying	IN
to	NN
grab	IN
Iran	NN
.	IN

But	IN
that	NN
ghost	IN
would	NN
n't	IN
settle	NN
for	IN
words	NN
,	IN
he	NN
wanted	IN
money	NN
and	IN
people	NN
--	IN
lots	NN
.	IN

So	IN
Mr.	NN
Carter	IN
formed	NN
three	IN
new	NN
Army	IN
divisions	NN
and	IN
gave	NN
them	IN
to	NN
a	IN
new	NN
bureaucracy	IN
in	NN
Tampa	IN
called	NN
the	IN
Rapid	NN
Deployment	IN
Force	NN
.	IN

But	IN
that	NN
ghost	IN
was	NN
n't	IN
fooled	NN
;	IN
he	NN
knew	IN
the	NN
RDF	IN
was	NN
neither	IN
rapid	NN
nor	IN
deployable	NN
nor	IN
a	NN
force	IN
--	NN
even	IN
though	NN
it	IN
cost	NN
$	IN
8	NN
billion	IN
or	NN
$	IN
10	NN
billion	IN
a	NN
year	IN
.	NN

After	IN
Mr.	NN
Carter	IN
was	NN
defeated	IN
in	NN
1980	IN
,	NN
the	IN
shah	NN
's	IN
ghost	NN
claimed	IN
the	NN
credit	IN
and	NN
then	IN
went	NN
after	IN
President	NN
Reagan	IN
and	NN
Cap	IN
Weinberger	NN
.	IN

I	IN
saw	NN
what	IN
he	NN
did	IN
to	NN
them	IN
firsthand	NN
.	IN

It	IN
made	NN
my	IN
shoelaces	NN
dance	IN
with	NN
terror	IN
.	NN

Why	IN
,	NN
he	IN
used	NN
to	IN
lay	NN
in	IN
wait	NN
for	IN
Cap	NN
;	IN
suddenly	NN
he	IN
'd	NN
leap	IN
from	NN
behind	IN
some	NN
statue	IN
of	NN
Marshall	IN
onto	NN
Cap	IN
's	NN
chest	IN
and	NN
grab	IN
him	NN
by	IN
the	NN
throat	IN
and	NN
choke	IN
him	NN
till	IN
he	NN
coughed	IN
up	NN
an	IN
additional	NN
$	IN
2	NN
billion	IN
or	NN
so	IN
.	NN

Cap	IN
added	NN
four	IN
more	NN
divisions	IN
to	NN
the	IN
Army	NN
,	IN
two	NN
active	IN
and	NN
two	IN
reserve	NN
;	IN
two	NN

and	IN
the	NN
C-5B	IN

KC-10	IN
,	NN
C-17	IN
and	NN
a	IN
thousand	NN
tactical	IN
aircraft	NN
to	IN
the	NN
Air	IN
Force	NN
.	IN

He	IN
bought	NN
$	IN
4	NN
billion	IN
in	NN
prepositioning	IN
ships	NN
and	IN
$	NN
7	IN
billion	NN
in	IN
ammo	NN
and	IN
equipment	NN
to	IN
fill	NN
them	IN
,	NN
and	IN
parked	NN
them	IN
at	NN
a	IN
new	NN
$	IN
6	NN
billion	IN
base	NN
at	IN
Diego	NN
Garcia	IN
in	NN
the	IN
middle	NN
of	IN
the	NN
Indian	IN
Ocean	NN
.	IN

He	IN
dedicated	NN
all	IN
these	NN
new	IN
forces	NN
to	IN
the	NN
Persian	IN
Gulf	NN
.	IN

One	IN
night	NN
both	IN
Marshall	NN
's	IN
ghost	NN
and	IN
the	NN
shah	IN
's	NN
ghost	IN
together	NN
caught	IN
Cap	NN
and	IN
threw	NN
him	IN
to	NN
the	IN
ground	NN
.	IN

Before	IN
they	NN
let	IN
him	NN
go	IN
he	NN
added	IN
a	NN
thousand	IN
bureaucrats	NN
to	IN
the	NN
RDF	IN
in	NN
Tampa	IN
and	NN
renamed	IN
it	NN
Central	IN
Command	NN
.	IN

He	IN
gave	NN
those	IN
bureaucrats	NN
charge	IN
of	NN
all	IN
naval	NN
operations	IN
in	NN
the	IN
Persian	NN
Gulf	IN
and	NN
Indian	IN
Ocean	NN
.	IN

Marshall	IN
figured	NN
it	IN
would	NN
be	IN
good	NN
training	IN
for	NN
those	IN
soldiers	NN
--	IN
someday	NN
maybe	IN
they	NN
would	IN
get	NN
the	IN
whole	NN
Navy	IN
.	NN

They	IN
had	NN
fun	IN
moving	NN
the	IN
carriers	NN
around	IN
,	NN
but	IN
it	NN
turned	IN
out	NN
that	IN
they	NN
had	IN
forgotten	NN
all	IN
about	NN
mine	IN
sweepers	NN
.	IN

But	IN
the	NN
shah	IN
still	NN
kept	IN
leaping	NN
out	IN
at	NN
Cap	IN
,	NN
so	IN
Cap	NN
bought	IN
a	NN
hundred	IN
merchant	NN
ships	IN
more	NN
and	IN
$	NN
7	IN
billion	NN
of	IN
loading	NN
barges	IN
,	NN
ramps	IN
,	NN
etc.	IN
,	NN
in	IN
order	NN
that	IN
those	NN
seven	IN
new	NN
Army	IN
divisions	NN
and	IN
three	NN
Marine	IN
brigades	NN
could	IN
unload	NN
from	IN
all	NN
those	IN
new	NN
ships	IN
and	NN
aircraft	IN
and	NN
go	IN
to	NN
war	IN
in	NN
the	IN
Zagros	NN
mountains	IN
.	NN

Then	IN
suddenly	NN
Ike	IN
's	NN
ghost	IN
came	NN
to	IN
visit	NN
and	IN
said	NN
,	IN
``	NN
What	IN

''	NN

Lucky	IN
for	NN
Cap	IN
,	NN
Ike	IN
was	NN
easygoing	IN
and	NN
soon	IN
went	NN
away	IN
,	NN
while	IN
the	NN
shah	IN
--	NN
he	IN
kept	NN
coming	IN
back	NN
.	IN

So	IN
the	NN
U.S.	IN
found	NN
itself	IN
paying	NN
about	IN
$	NN
2	IN

in	IN
baksheesh	NN
to	IN
various	NN
Arab	IN
potentates	NN
for	IN

the	IN

We	IN
had	NN
great	IN
success	NN
in	IN
Somalia	NN

But	IN
then	NN
it	IN
turned	NN
out	IN
that	NN
President	IN
Siad	NN
Barrah	IN
was	NN
not	IN
at	NN
all	IN
a	NN
nice	IN
person	NN
and	IN
the	NN
Navy	IN
pointed	NN
out	IN
that	NN
the	IN
base	NN
he	IN
promised	NN
us	IN
in	NN
Berbera	IN
had	NN
silted	IN
up	NN
about	IN
a	NN
hundred	IN
years	NN

anyway	IN
was	NN

Still	IN
,	NN
Berbera	IN
was	NN
the	IN

we	IN
could	NN
get	IN

so	IN
we	NN
stay	IN
in	NN

with	NN
President	IN
Barrah	NN
.	IN

All	IN
these	NN
reports	IN
about	NN
him	IN
committing	NN

are	NN
probably	IN
exaggerated	NN

would	NN

we	IN
are	NN

the	NN

Predictably	IN

some	IN
