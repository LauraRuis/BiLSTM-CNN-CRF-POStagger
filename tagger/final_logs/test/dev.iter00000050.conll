Reasons	IN
for	NN
the	NN
collapse	IN
of	NN
the	NN
Nimitz	IN
Freeway	NN
were	NN
sketchy	IN
yesterday	NN
.	NN

But	IN
most	NN
structural	NN
engineers	IN
attributed	NN
the	NN
destruction	IN
to	NN
improper	NN
reinforcement	IN
of	NN
the	NN
columns	IN
that	NN
supported	NN
the	IN
decks	NN
,	NN
and	IN
the	NN
fact	NN
that	IN
the	NN
ground	NN
beneath	IN
the	NN
highway	NN
is	IN
largely	NN
landfill	NN
and	IN
can	NN
become	NN
unstable	IN
,	NN
or	NN
``	IN
liquefy	NN
,	NN
''	IN
in	NN
a	NN
major	IN

The	IN
two-story	NN
roadway	NN
,	IN
designed	NN
in	NN
the	IN
mid-1940s	NN
and	NN
completed	IN
in	NN
1957	NN
,	IN
was	NN
supported	NN
by	IN
columns	NN
that	NN
apparently	IN
lacked	NN
the	NN
kind	IN
of	NN
steel	NN
reinforcement	IN
used	NN
in	NN
highways	IN
today	NN
.	NN

While	IN
the	NN
pillars	NN
did	IN
have	NN
long	NN
metal	IN
bars	NN
running	NN
vertically	IN
through	NN
them	NN
for	IN
reinforcement	NN
,	NN
they	IN
apparently	NN
lacked	NN
an	IN
adequate	NN
number	NN
of	IN
metal	NN
``	NN
ties	IN
''	NN
that	NN
run	IN
horizontally	NN
through	NN

Leo	NN

a	NN

Caltrans	IN
today	NN

the	IN

Mr.	NN
Parker	IN
describes	NN
,	NN
with	IN

But	IN
in	NN
the	NN
case	IN
of	NN
the	NN
Nimitz	IN
Freeway	NN
,	NN
the	IN
lack	NN
of	NN
such	IN
support	NN
caused	NN
the	IN
core	NN
of	NN
the	IN
columns	NN
to	NN
crumble	IN
and	NN
buckle	NN
under	IN
the	NN
weight	NN
of	IN
the	NN
second	NN

Officials	IN

the	NN
state	IN

did	NN
n't	IN
have	NN
any	NN
immediate	IN
explanation	NN
why	NN
the	IN

up	NN

Caltrans	IN
reinforced	NN

of	NN
a	IN

Caltrans	IN
spokesman	NN
Jim	NN

declined	IN
to	NN
identify	NN
the	IN

the	NN

work	NN

Liability	IN
in	NN
the	NN
bridge	IN

road	NN

will	NN
revolve	NN
around	IN
whether	NN

in	IN
a	NN

at	NN

achieved	NN
a	NN
good	IN

out	IN
of	NN
``	NN

Further	IN

came	NN

Mr.	IN

opponents	IN
chose	NN
the	NN
battlefield	IN

held	NN
it	IN

kept	NN
it	IN

Yet	IN
with	NN
the	NN
smooth	IN

of	NN
Anthony	IN
Kennedy	NN
,	NN
an	IN
``	NN
80	NN
percenter	IN
''	NN
only	NN
slightly	IN
less	NN

Mr.	NN

,	IN
the	NN
Democrats	NN
may	IN
have	NN
won	NN
the	IN
battle	NN
but	NN
lost	IN
the	NN
war	NN
.	IN

Another	IN
upshot	NN
,	NN
however	IN
,	NN
was	NN
the	IN
chilling	NN
message	NN
the	IN
Bork	NN
hearings	NN
sent	IN
into	NN
the	NN
judicial	IN
culture	NN
from	NN
which	IN
the	NN
Supreme	NN
Court	IN
draws	NN
its	NN
talent	IN
.	NN

The	IN
word	NN
went	NN
forth	IN
to	NN
every	NN
law	IN
school	NN
that	NN
those	IN
with	NN
federal	NN
court	IN
ambitions	NN
must	NN
travel	IN
a	NN
safe	NN
constitutional	IN
journey	NN

with	IN
no	NN
paper	NN
trail	IN
and	NN
no	NN
bite	IN
to	NN
their	NN
tongue	IN

pen	NN

Unfortunately	IN
,	NN
the	NN
author	IN
simply	NN
does	NN
n't	IN
supply	NN
the	NN
philosophical	IN
frame	NN
to	NN
sustain	IN
his	NN
reportorial	NN
talents	IN

He	IN
has	NN
too	NN
readily	IN
swallowed	NN
the	NN
case	IN
for	NN
the	NN

Probing	IN
more	NN
deeply	NN
into	IN
the	NN
doctrine	NN
of	IN
``	NN
judicial	NN
restraint	IN
,	NN
''	NN
he	IN
would	NN
have	NN
found	IN
a	NN
long	NN
history	IN
going	NN
back	NN
to	IN
the	NN
great	NN
decisions	IN
of	NN

Holmes	IN

He	IN
would	NN
discover	NN
it	IN

subtle	NN
constitutional	NN
scholar	IN

Mr.	NN

influence	NN

goes	IN
well	NN
beyond	NN
Mr.	IN

Still	IN
,	NN
the	NN
long	IN
view	NN
of	NN
Robert	IN
Bork	NN
as	NN
constitutional	IN
thinker	NN
must	NN
be	IN
a	NN
spotty	NN
one	IN
.	NN

His	IN
strength	NN
lies	NN
in	IN
his	NN
majoritarian	NN
doctrine	IN
,	NN
which	NN
keeps	IN
the	NN
Court	NN
clear	IN
of	NN
transient	NN
group	IN
pressures	NN
and	NN
leaves	IN
most	NN
decisions	NN
in	IN
a	NN
democracy	NN
to	IN
elected	NN
legislatures	NN
and	IN

Unfortunately	IN
,	NN
Mr.	NN
Bork	IN
failed	NN
to	NN
distinguish	IN
between	NN
such	NN
pressures	IN
and	NN
the	NN
emergence	IN
of	NN
great	NN
issues	IN
critical	NN
to	NN
a	IN
society	NN
that	NN
must	IN
be	NN
settled	NN
judicially	IN

can	NN

fear	IN
that	NN
the	NN

that	NN

bad	IN
for	NN

counter-argument	NN

which	IN
he	NN

heard	IN

is	NN
that	IN
if	NN

open	NN

The	IN

table	NN

this	NN

would	NN
work	NN
for	IN
three	NN
stocks	NN

Though	IN
not	NN
reflected	NN
in	IN
the	NN
table	NN
,	IN
an	NN
investor	NN
should	IN
know	NN
that	NN
the	IN
cost	NN
of	NN
the	IN
option	NN
insurance	NN
can	IN
be	NN
partially	NN
offset	IN
by	NN
any	NN
dividends	IN
that	NN
the	NN
stock	IN
pays	NN
.	NN

For	IN
example	NN
,	NN
Tenneco	IN
Inc.	NN
pays	NN
a	IN
quarterly	NN
dividend	NN
of	IN
76	NN
cents	NN
,	IN
which	NN
would	NN
be	IN
received	NN
before	NN
the	IN
February	NN
option	NN
expires	IN
and	NN
,	NN
thus	IN
,	NN
reduce	NN
the	IN
cost	NN
of	NN
using	IN
the	NN
technique	NN
by	IN
that	NN
amount	NN
.	IN

In	IN
this	NN
case	NN
,	IN
the	NN
investor	NN
's	IN
risk	NN
would	NN
n't	IN
exceed	NN
3.6	NN
%	IN
of	NN
the	NN
total	IN
investment	NN
.	NN

To	IN
simplify	NN
the	NN
calculations	IN
,	NN
commissions	NN
on	IN
the	NN
option	NN
and	IN
underlying	NN
stock	NN
are	IN
n't	NN
included	NN
in	IN
the	NN
table	NN
.	IN

There	IN
are	NN
more	NN
than	IN
650	NN
stocks	NN
on	IN
which	NN
options	NN
may	IN
be	NN
bought	NN
and	IN
sold	NN
,	NN
including	IN
some	NN
over-the-counter	NN
stocks	IN
.	NN

But	IN
some	NN
investors	NN
might	IN
prefer	NN
a	NN
simpler	IN
strategy	NN
then	NN
hedging	IN
their	NN
individual	NN
holdings	IN
.	NN

They	IN
can	NN
do	NN
this	IN
by	NN
purchasing	NN
``	IN
index	NN
puts	NN
,	IN
''	NN
which	NN
are	IN
simply	NN
put	NN
options	IN
on	NN
indexes	NN
that	IN
match	NN
broad	NN
baskets	IN
of	NN
stocks	NN
.	IN

For	IN
instance	NN
,	NN
the	IN
most	NN
popular	NN
index	IN
option	NN
is	NN
the	IN
S&P	NN
100	NN
option	IN
,	NN
commonly	NN
called	IN
the	NN
OEX	NN
.	IN

It	IN
is	NN
based	NN
on	IN
the	NN
stocks	NN
that	IN
make	NN
up	NN
Standard	IN
&	NN
Poor	NN
's	IN
100-stock	NN
index	NN
.	IN

Unlike	IN
options	NN
on	NN
individual	IN
issues	NN
,	NN
index	IN
options	NN
are	NN
settled	IN
only	NN
in	NN
cash	IN
,	NN
and	NN
no	IN
stock	NN
is	NN
ever	IN
tendered	NN
.	NN

But	IN
while	NN
index	NN
options	IN
are	NN
convenient	NN
,	IN
they	NN
have	NN
several	IN
disadvantages	NN
.	NN

For	IN
one	NN
thing	NN
,	IN
an	NN
investor	NN
's	IN
portfolio	NN
might	NN
not	IN
closely	NN
match	NN
the	IN
S&P	NN
100	NN
.	IN

As	IN
a	NN
result	NN
,	IN
the	NN
OEX	NN
insurance	IN
may	NN
or	NN
may	IN
not	NN
fully	NN
protect	IN
an	NN
investor	NN
's	IN
holdings	NN
in	NN
the	IN
event	NN
of	NN
a	IN
market	NN
decline	NN
.	IN

In	IN
addition	NN
,	NN
OEX	IN
options	NN
were	NN
suspended	IN
from	NN
trading	NN
last	IN
Friday	NN
afternoon	NN
,	IN
after	NN
the	NN
stock-market	IN
sell-off	NN
got	NN
under	IN
way	NN
and	NN
trading	IN
in	NN
the	NN
S&P-500	IN
futures	NN
contract	NN
was	IN
halted	NN
.	NN

So	IN
an	NN
investor	NN
who	IN
wanted	NN
to	NN
realize	IN
a	NN
profit	NN
on	IN
OEX	NN
puts	NN
after	IN
the	NN
trading	NN
suspension	IN
would	NN
have	NN
been	IN
out	NN
of	NN
luck	IN
.	NN

On	IN
the	NN
other	NN
hand	IN
,	NN
only	NN
a	IN
handful	NN
of	NN
individual	IN
issues	NN
were	NN
suspended	IN
from	NN
trading	NN
on	IN
Friday	NN
.	NN

Normally	IN
,	NN
once	NN
the	IN
underlying	NN
investment	NN
is	IN
suspended	NN
from	NN
trading	IN
,	NN
the	NN
options	IN
on	NN
those	NN
investments	IN
also	NN
do	NN
n't	IN
trade	NN
.	NN

Ultimately	IN
,	NN
whether	NN
the	IN
insurance	NN
provided	NN
by	IN
purchasing	NN
puts	NN
is	IN
worthwhile	NN
depends	NN
on	IN
the	NN
cost	NN
of	IN
the	NN
options	NN
.	IN

That	IN
cost	NN
rises	NN
in	IN
times	NN
of	NN
high	IN
market	NN
volatility	NN
.	IN

But	IN
it	NN
still	NN
might	IN
be	NN
cheaper	NN
than	IN
taking	NN
a	NN
major	IN
hit	NN
.	NN

The	IN
protection	NN
from	NN
using	IN
married	NN
puts	NN
is	IN
clearly	NN
superior	NN
to	IN
that	NN
afforded	NN
by	IN
another	NN
options	NN
strategy	IN
some	NN
investors	NN
consider	IN
using	NN
during	NN
troubled	IN
times	NN
:	NN
selling	IN
call	NN
options	NN
on	IN
stocks	NN
the	NN
investor	IN
owns	NN
.	NN

A	IN
call	NN
option	NN
is	IN
similar	NN
to	NN
a	IN
put	NN
,	NN
except	IN
that	NN
it	NN
gives	IN
its	NN
owner	NN
the	IN
right	NN
to	NN
buy	IN
shares	NN
at	NN
a	IN
stated	NN
price	NN
until	IN
expiration	NN
.	NN

Selling	IN
a	NN
call	NN
option	IN
gives	NN
an	NN
investor	IN
a	NN
small	NN
buffer	IN
against	NN
a	NN
stock-market	IN
decline	NN
.	NN

That	IN
's	NN
because	NN
it	IN
reduces	NN
the	NN
cost	IN
of	NN

not	IN
that	NN
the	NN
resistance	IN
has	NN
failed	NN
to	IN

says	NN
the	NN

his	NN

was	NN
to	NN
make	IN
his	NN
point	NN
that	IN
Americans	NN
have	NN
rights	IN
as	NN
individuals	NN
,	IN
not	NN
as	NN
members	IN
of	NN
certain	NN
select	IN

His	IN

criticized	NN
the	IN
``	NN

Mr.	NN

The	IN
three	NN
most	NN
important	IN
things	NN
to	NN
understand	IN
about	NN
Mr.	NN

is	NN
that	NN
he	IN
is	NN
a	NN
black	IN
conservative	NN
intellectual	NN
--	IN
a	NN
triple	NN
threat	IN
to	NN
the	NN
liberal	IN

Mr.	IN

,	NN
who	IN
teaches	NN
government	NN

California	IN

will	NN
remain	IN
a	NN
member	NN

has	NN
spent	NN
years	IN
arguing	NN
that	NN
civil	IN
rights	NN
are	NN
individuals	IN
'	NN
rights	NN

He	IN
last	NN
made	NN
waves	IN
when	NN
he	NN
dared	IN
to	NN
defend	NN
an	IN
Indian	NN
girl	NN
who	IN
had	NN
been	NN
adopted	IN
by	NN
non-Indian	NN
parents	IN
off	NN
her	NN
reservation	IN
.	NN

Mr.	IN
Allen	NN
quickly	NN
ran	IN
up	NN
against	NN
the	IN
liberal	NN
establishment	NN
again	IN
,	NN
which	NN
somehow	IN
elevated	NN
the	NN
vague	IN
concept	NN
of	NN
``	IN
Indian	NN
rights	NN
''	IN
above	NN
the	NN
rights	IN
of	NN
individual	NN
Indians	IN

There	IN
is	NN
a	NN
huge	IN
divide	NN
between	NN
Mr.	IN
Allen	NN
's	NN
we're-all-in-this-together	IN
view	NN
and	NN
the	IN
divisive	NN
litigation	NN
approach	IN
of	NN
the	NN
civil	IN
rights	NN
groups	NN
.	IN

Indeed	IN
,	NN
the	NN
gap	IN
is	NN
so	NN
large	IN
that	NN
Mr.	NN
Allen	IN
's	NN
critics	NN
refuse	IN
to	NN
engage	NN
the	IN
debate	NN

Their	IN
ridicule	NN
of	NN
him	IN

no	NN
substitute	IN
for	NN
argument	NN

Their	IN
effort	NN
to	NN
run	IN

It	IN

Yet	IN
it	NN
is	NN
also	IN
axiomatic	NN
that	NN
the	IN

Beginning	IN
in	NN
the	NN
early	IN
19th	NN
century	NN
,	IN
with	NN
U.S.	NN
v.	IN
Hudson	NN
and	NN
Goodwin	IN
,	NN
the	NN
Supreme	IN

has	NN
repeatedly	IN
held	NN
that	NN
a	IN
judicial	NN
power	NN
to	IN
declare	NN
conduct	NN
to	IN
be	NN
against	NN
the	IN
public	NN
interest	NN
and	IN
hence	NN
criminal	NN
,	IN
while	NN
well	NN
established	IN
in	NN
British	NN

would	NN
usurp	IN
legislative	NN
authority	NN
under	IN
the	NN
doctrine	NN
of	IN
separation	NN
of	NN
powers	IN

That	IN
's	NN
the	NN
conventional	IN
theory	NN
anyway	NN

In	IN
practice	NN

however	IN
,	NN
the	NN
line	IN
between	NN
interpretation	NN
and	IN
redefinition	NN
of	NN
the	IN
criminal	NN
law	NN
long	IN

began	NN
to	IN
blur	NN

In	IN
particular	NN
,	NN
a	IN
common	NN
law	NN
of	IN
white-collar	NN
crime	NN
has	IN
developed	NN
with	NN
surprising	IN
rapidity	NN
over	NN
the	IN
past	NN
decade	NN
.	IN

For	IN
example	NN
,	NN
although	IN
insider	NN
trading	NN
has	IN
long	NN
been	NN
criminal	IN
,	NN
it	NN
has	IN
never	NN
been	NN
statutorily	IN
defined	NN
.	NN

In	IN
1983	NN
,	NN
the	IN
Supreme	NN
Court	NN
tried	IN
to	NN
supply	NN
a	IN
workable	NN
definition	NN
in	IN
the	NN
Dirks	NN
v.	IN
SEC	NN
decision	NN
,	IN
which	NN
found	NN
that	IN
liability	NN
depended	NN
on	IN
whether	NN
the	NN
tipper	IN
had	NN
breached	NN
his	IN
fiduciary	NN
duty	NN
to	IN
the	NN
corporation	NN
in	IN

obtain	IN
``	NN
some	NN

''	NN
and	IN
whether	NN
the	NN
tippee	IN
knew	NN
or	NN
recklessly	IN
disregarded	NN
this	NN
fact	IN
.	NN

Gradually	IN
,	NN
however	NN
,	IN
lower	NN
courts	NN
and	IN
prosecutors	NN
have	NN
pushed	IN
this	NN
definition	NN
to	IN
its	NN
breaking	NN
point	IN

Consider	IN

the	NN
1989	NN
conviction	IN

Robert	NN

Basically	IN

Mr.	NN

Did	IN
Mr.	NN

did	NN
Mr.	NN

hear	NN
a	IN

rumor	NN
(	IN
which	NN

The	IN

A	IN
second	NN
illustration	NN
is	IN
supplied	NN
by	NN
the	IN
recent	NN
guilty	NN
plea	IN
entered	NN
by	NN
Robert	IN
Freeman	NN
,	NN
formerly	IN
head	NN
of	NN
arbitrage	IN
at	NN
Goldman	NN
,	IN
Sachs	NN
&	NN
Co	IN
.	NN

Essentially	IN
,	NN
Mr.	NN
Freeman	IN
had	NN
invested	NN
heavily	IN
in	NN
the	NN
Beatrice	IN
leveraged	NN
buy-out	NN
,	IN
when	NN
he	NN
was	IN
told	NN
by	NN
another	IN
prominent	NN

,	IN
Bernard	NN
``	NN
Bunny	IN
''	NN
Lasker	NN
,	IN
that	NN
the	NN
deal	IN
was	NN
in	NN
trouble	IN
.	NN

After	IN
placing	NN
orders	NN
to	IN
sell	NN
,	NN
Mr.	IN
Freeman	NN
called	NN
Martin	IN
Siegel	NN
,	NN
an	IN
investment	NN
banker	NN
at	IN
Kidder	NN
,	NN
Peabody	IN
&	NN
Co.	NN
,	IN
who	NN
was	NN
advising	IN
on	NN
the	NN
deal	IN
,	NN
to	NN
confirm	IN
these	NN
rumors	NN
.	IN

Mr.	IN
Siegel	NN
asked	NN
Mr.	IN
Freeman	NN
who	NN
his	IN
source	NN
was	NN
and	IN
,	NN
on	NN
hearing	IN
that	NN
it	NN
was	IN
Bunny	NN
Lasker	NN
,	IN
responded	NN
:	NN
``	IN
Well	NN
,	NN
your	IN
bunny	NN
has	NN
a	IN

''	NN

The	IN
illegal	NN
``	NN
tip	IN
''	NN
of	NN
the	IN
bunny	NN
's	NN
good	IN
nose	NN
was	NN
then	IN
largely	NN
a	NN
confirmation	IN
of	NN
rumors	NN
already	IN
known	NN
to	NN
many	IN
in	NN
the	NN
market	IN
.	NN

Had	IN
the	NN
case	NN
gone	IN
to	NN
trial	NN
the	IN
same	NN
issues	NN
would	IN
have	NN
surfaced	NN
:	IN

Was	IN
there	NN
a	NN
fiduciary	IN
breach	NN
in	NN
order	IN
to	NN
obtain	NN
personal	IN
gain	NN
?	NN

Did	IN
Mr.	NN
Freeman	NN
have	IN
notice	NN
of	NN
this	IN
?	NN

Finally	IN
,	NN
was	NN
the	IN
information	NN
material	NN
?	IN

Yet	IN
,	NN
all	NN
these	IN
issues	NN
are	NN
subsidiary	IN
to	NN
a	NN
more	IN
central	NN
issue	NN
:	IN
Who	NN
is	NN
and	IN
who	NN
should	NN
be	IN
making	NN
the	NN
criminal	IN
law	NN
here	NN
?	IN

It	IN
is	NN
not	NN
my	IN
contention	NN
that	NN
either	IN
Mr.	NN
Chestman	NN
or	IN
Mr.	NN
Freeman	NN
was	IN
an	NN
innocent	NN
victim	IN
of	NN
prosecutorial	NN
overzealousness	IN
.	NN

Arguably	IN
,	NN
both	NN
were	IN
on	NN
notice	NN
that	IN
their	NN
behavior	NN
was	IN
at	NN
least	NN
risky	IN
.	NN

But	IN
even	NN
if	NN
they	IN
behaved	NN
recklessly	NN
,	IN
reasons	NN
still	NN
exist	IN
to	NN
fear	NN
and	IN
resist	NN
this	NN
steady	IN
process	NN
of	NN
case-by-case	IN
judicial	NN
extension	NN
of	IN
the	NN
law	NN
of	IN
insider	NN
trading	NN
.	IN

Courts	IN
and	NN
legislatures	NN
make	IN
decisions	NN
in	NN
very	IN
different	NN
ways	NN
and	IN
are	NN
each	NN
susceptible	IN
to	NN
very	NN
different	IN
kinds	NN
of	NN
errors	IN
.	NN

After-the-fact	IN
judicial	NN
examination	NN
of	IN
an	NN
actor	NN
's	IN
conduct	NN
has	NN
always	IN
been	NN
the	NN
common	IN
law	NN
's	NN
method	IN
.	NN

When	IN
only	NN
civil	NN
liability	IN
is	NN
involved	NN
,	IN
this	NN
method	NN
has	IN
the	NN
undeniable	NN
strengths	IN
of	NN
factual	NN
specificity	IN
and	NN
avoidance	NN
of	IN
overgeneralization	NN
.	NN

Still	IN
,	NN
case-by-case	NN
retrospective	IN
decision	NN
making	NN
of	IN
this	NN
sort	NN
is	IN
vulnerable	NN
to	NN
the	IN
tunnel	NN
vision	NN
caused	IN
by	NN
a	NN
fixation	IN
on	NN
ad	NN
hoc	IN
(	NN
and	NN
usually	IN
sleazy	NN
)	NN
examples	IN
.	NN

When	IN
a	NN
court	NN
decides	IN
that	NN
a	NN
particular	IN
actor	NN
's	NN
conduct	IN
was	NN
culpable	NN
and	IN
so	NN
extends	NN
the	IN
definition	NN
of	NN
insider	IN
trading	NN
to	NN
reach	IN
this	NN
conduct	NN
,	IN
it	NN
does	NN
not	IN
see	NN
the	NN
potentially	IN
enormous	NN
number	NN
of	IN
other	NN
cases	NN
that	IN
will	NN
be	NN
covered	IN
by	NN
the	NN
expanded	IN
rule	NN
.	NN

Thus	IN
,	NN
a	NN
court	IN
is	NN
poorly	NN
positioned	IN
to	NN
make	NN
judgments	IN
about	NN
the	NN
social	IN
utility	NN
of	NN
the	IN
expanded	NN
rule	NN

For	IN

in	IN
focusing	NN
on	NN
Mr.	IN

's	NN
attempt	IN
to	NN
gain	NN
nonpublic	IN
information	NN
about	NN

naturally	NN
think	IN
about	NN
the	NN

side	NN
of	NN
the	IN
coin	NN
:	NN
What	IN
if	NN
the	NN
rumor	IN
had	NN
been	NN
false	IN
?	NN

Can	IN
a	NN
security	NN
analyst	IN
call	NN
an	NN
investment	IN

to	NN
make	IN
certain	NN
that	NN
a	IN
seemingly	NN
improbable	NN
rumor	IN
is	NN
in	NN
fact	IN
false	NN
?	NN

In	IN
the	NN
past	NN
,	IN
not	NN
only	NN
would	IN
reputable	NN
professionals	NN
have	IN
rushed	NN
to	NN
check	IN
out	NN
such	NN
rumors	IN
with	NN
the	NN
company	IN

but	NN
companies	IN
listed	NN
on	NN
the	IN

stock	NN

by	IN
the	NN
exchanges	NN
to	IN
respond	NN
openly	NN
to	IN
such	NN
inquiries	NN
from	IN
securities	NN
analysts	NN
.	IN

Today	IN
,	NN
after	NN
Mr.	IN
Freeman	NN
's	NN
plea	IN

there	NN
is	IN
an	NN
uncertainty	NN
that	IN

both	NN
unfair	IN
and	NN
inefficient	NN
.	IN

In	IN
this	NN

legislative	NN
law-making	IN

clear	NN

with	IN

much	IN

did	NN
some	IN

interest	NN

The	IN
reason	NN

say	NN

is	NN
that	NN
the	IN

some	IN

Perhaps	IN
the	NN

of	IN

factors	NN
is	IN

When	IN

dollars	NN

the	IN
high	NN

a	NN

To	IN
combat	NN
that	NN
problem	IN
,	NN
National	NN
Geographic	IN
,	NN
like	NN
other	IN

began	IN

Dual	IN

gives	NN
an	IN

the	IN
right	NN
to	NN
trade	IN
both	NN
for	NN
his	IN

The	IN
issue	NN
exploded	NN
this	IN
year	NN
after	NN
a	IN
Federal	NN
Bureau	NN
of	IN
Investigation	NN
operation	NN
led	IN
to	NN
charges	NN

abuses	IN
at	NN
the	NN
Chicago	IN

While	IN
not	NN

dual	IN

became	NN
a	IN
focus	NN
of	NN
attempts	IN
to	NN
tighten	NN
industry	IN

Critics	IN

that	NN

their	NN

Traders	IN
are	NN
likely	NN
to	IN
oppose	NN
such	NN
restrictions	IN
because	NN
dual	NN
trading	IN
provides	NN
a	NN
way	IN
to	NN
make	NN
money	IN
in	NN
slower	NN
markets	IN
where	NN
there	NN
is	IN
a	NN
shortage	NN

.	IN

The	IN
exchanges	NN
contend	NN
that	IN
dual	NN
trading	NN
improves	IN
liquidity	NN
in	NN
the	IN
markets	NN
because	NN
traders	IN
can	NN
buy	NN
or	IN
sell	NN
even	NN
when	IN
they	NN
do	NN
n't	IN
have	NN
a	NN
customer	IN

The	IN

say	NN
liquidity	IN
becomes	NN

such	IN
as	NN
those	NN
with	IN
a	NN
long	NN

The	IN

may	NN
take	IN
those	NN
arguments	NN

account	NN
by	NN
allowing	IN

the	IN

You	IN

had	NN
this	NN
thing	IN
about	NN
the	NN

he	NN
wanted	IN

Now	IN
his	NN

n't	NN
let	NN
up	IN

it	NN
's	IN
done	NN

To	IN
keep	NN
him	NN
quiet	IN
we	NN
invent	NN
a	IN

every	NN

run	NN
by	IN
the	NN

put	NN

the	NN

under	IN
it	NN

But	IN
we	NN
still	NN
hear	IN
him	NN
moaning	NN
at	IN

because	NN
the	IN

has	NN
a	IN

left	IN

to	IN

him	NN
the	IN

Which	IN
brings	NN
up	NN
the	IN
worst	NN
and	NN
meanest	IN
ghost	NN
of	NN
all	IN
--	NN
the	NN
ghost	IN
of	NN
the	NN
shah	IN
of	NN
Iran	NN
.	IN

When	IN
the	NN
shah	NN
died	IN
,	NN
President	NN
Carter	IN
was	NN
so	NN
scared	IN
that	NN
the	NN
shah	IN
's	NN
ghost	NN
would	IN
blame	NN
him	NN
for	IN
shoving	NN
him	NN
out	IN
to	NN
make	NN
way	IN
for	NN
the	NN
ayatollah	IN
that	NN
he	NN
declared	IN
the	NN
Carter	NN
Doctrine	IN
.	NN

Mr.	IN
Carter	NN
said	NN
he	IN
would	NN
go	NN
to	IN
war	NN
to	NN
stop	IN
anyone	NN
from	NN
trying	IN
to	NN
grab	NN
Iran	IN
.	NN

But	IN
that	NN
ghost	NN
would	IN
n't	NN
settle	NN
for	IN
words	NN
,	NN
he	IN
wanted	NN
money	NN
and	IN
people	NN
--	NN
lots	IN
.	NN

So	IN
Mr.	NN
Carter	NN
formed	IN
three	NN
new	NN
Army	IN
divisions	NN
and	NN
gave	IN
them	NN
to	NN
a	IN
new	NN
bureaucracy	NN
in	IN
Tampa	NN
called	NN
the	IN
Rapid	NN
Deployment	NN
Force	IN
.	NN

But	IN
that	NN
ghost	NN
was	IN
n't	NN
fooled	NN
;	IN
he	NN
knew	NN
the	IN
RDF	NN
was	NN
neither	IN
rapid	NN
nor	NN
deployable	IN
nor	NN
a	NN
force	IN
--	NN
even	NN
though	IN
it	NN
cost	NN
$	IN
8	NN
billion	NN
or	IN
$	NN
10	NN
billion	IN
a	NN
year	NN
.	IN

After	IN
Mr.	NN
Carter	NN
was	IN
defeated	NN
in	NN
1980	IN
,	NN
the	NN
shah	IN
's	NN
ghost	NN
claimed	IN
the	NN
credit	NN
and	IN
then	NN
went	NN
after	IN
President	NN
Reagan	NN
and	IN
Cap	NN
Weinberger	NN
.	IN

I	IN
saw	NN
what	NN
he	IN
did	NN
to	NN
them	IN
firsthand	NN
.	NN

It	IN
made	NN
my	NN
shoelaces	IN
dance	NN
with	NN
terror	IN
.	NN

Why	IN
,	NN
he	NN
used	IN
to	NN
lay	NN
in	IN
wait	NN
for	NN
Cap	IN
;	NN
suddenly	NN
he	IN
'd	NN
leap	NN
from	IN
behind	NN
some	NN
statue	IN
of	NN
Marshall	NN
onto	IN
Cap	NN
's	NN
chest	IN
and	NN
grab	NN
him	IN
by	NN
the	NN
throat	IN
and	NN
choke	NN
him	IN
till	NN
he	NN
coughed	IN
up	NN
an	NN
additional	IN
$	NN
2	NN
billion	IN
or	NN
so	NN
.	IN

Cap	IN
added	NN
four	NN
more	IN
divisions	NN
to	NN
the	IN
Army	NN
,	NN
two	IN
active	NN
and	NN
two	IN
reserve	NN

and	IN
the	NN
C-5B	NN

,	NN
C-17	IN
and	NN
a	NN
thousand	IN
tactical	NN
aircraft	NN
to	IN
the	NN
Air	NN
Force	IN
.	NN

He	IN
bought	NN
$	NN
4	IN
billion	NN
in	NN
prepositioning	IN
ships	NN
and	NN
$	IN
7	NN
billion	NN
in	IN
ammo	NN

to	NN
fill	NN
them	IN

and	NN
parked	IN
them	NN
at	NN
a	IN
new	NN

6	IN

base	NN
at	IN
Diego	NN
Garcia	NN
in	IN
the	NN
middle	NN
of	IN
the	NN
Indian	NN
Ocean	IN
.	NN

He	IN
dedicated	NN
all	NN
these	IN
new	NN
forces	NN
to	IN
the	NN
Persian	NN
Gulf	IN
.	NN

One	IN
night	NN
both	NN
Marshall	IN
's	NN
ghost	NN
and	IN
the	NN
shah	NN
's	IN
ghost	NN
together	NN
caught	IN
Cap	NN
and	NN
threw	IN
him	NN
to	NN
the	IN
ground	NN
.	NN

Before	IN
they	NN
let	NN
him	IN
go	NN
he	NN
added	IN
a	NN
thousand	NN
bureaucrats	IN
to	NN
the	NN
RDF	IN
in	NN
Tampa	NN
and	IN
renamed	NN
it	NN
Central	IN
Command	NN
.	NN

He	IN
gave	NN
those	NN
bureaucrats	IN
charge	NN
of	NN
all	IN
naval	NN
operations	NN
in	IN
the	NN
Persian	NN
Gulf	IN
and	NN
Indian	NN
Ocean	IN
.	NN

Marshall	IN
figured	NN
it	NN
would	IN
be	NN
good	NN
training	IN
for	NN
those	NN
soldiers	IN
--	NN
someday	NN
maybe	IN
they	NN
would	NN
get	IN
the	NN
whole	NN
Navy	IN
.	NN

They	IN
had	NN
fun	NN
moving	IN
the	NN
carriers	NN
around	IN
,	NN
but	NN
it	IN
turned	NN
out	NN
that	IN
they	NN
had	NN
forgotten	IN
all	NN
about	NN
mine	IN
sweepers	NN
.	NN

But	IN
the	NN
shah	NN
still	IN
kept	NN
leaping	NN
out	IN
at	NN
Cap	NN
,	IN
so	NN
Cap	NN
bought	IN
a	NN
hundred	NN
merchant	IN
ships	NN
more	NN
and	IN
$	NN
7	NN
billion	IN
of	NN
loading	NN
barges	IN
,	NN
ramps	NN
,	IN
etc.	NN
,	NN
in	IN
order	NN
that	NN
those	IN
seven	NN
new	NN
Army	IN
divisions	NN
and	NN
three	IN
Marine	NN
brigades	NN
could	IN
unload	NN
from	NN
all	IN
those	NN
new	NN
ships	IN
and	NN
aircraft	NN
and	IN
go	NN
to	NN
war	IN
in	NN
the	NN
Zagros	IN
mountains	NN
.	NN

Then	IN
suddenly	NN
Ike	NN
's	IN
ghost	NN
came	NN
to	IN
visit	NN
and	NN
said	IN
,	NN
``	NN
What	IN

Lucky	IN
for	NN

Ike	NN
was	NN
easygoing	IN

soon	NN
went	IN
away	NN

while	IN
the	NN

--	IN
he	NN
kept	NN
coming	IN
back	NN

So	IN
the	NN
U.S.	NN
found	IN
itself	NN
paying	NN
about	IN
$	NN
2	NN

We	IN
had	NN
great	NN
success	IN
in	NN

But	IN
then	NN
it	NN
turned	IN
out	NN
that	NN
President	IN
Siad	NN

was	IN
not	NN
at	NN
all	IN
a	NN
nice	NN
person	IN

the	NN

pointed	NN
out	NN
that	IN

he	IN
promised	NN
us	NN
in	IN
Berbera	NN
had	NN
silted	IN
up	NN
about	NN
a	IN

Berbera	NN
was	IN

could	NN

so	NN
we	NN
stay	IN
in	NN

with	IN
President	NN
Barrah	NN

All	IN
these	NN
reports	NN
about	IN
him	NN

the	NN

some	NN
