Mr.	,
Mason	,
said	,
that	,
many	,
Jewish	,

feel	,
guilty	DT
toward	NN

so	NN
they	NN
support	NN

He	,

that	,

bitter	NN
about	NN

they	NN
,	NN
too	NN
,	NN
support	NN
black	NN

uncritically	NN

He	,
said	,
that	,

have	,
contributed	,
more	,
to	,

over	NN

Of	,

,	,
Mr.	,
Mason	,
did	,
not	DT
use	NN
neutral	NN
language	NN

As	,
a	,
practitioner	,
of	,
ethnic	,
humor	,
from	,
the	,

days	DT
on	NN
the	NN
Borscht	NN
Belt	NN
,	NN
live	NN
television	NN
and	NN
the	NN
nightclub	NN
circuit	NN
,	NN
Mr.	NN
Mason	NN
instinctively	NN
reached	NN
for	NN
the	NN
vernacular	NN
.	NN

He	,
said	,
Jews	,
were	,
``	,
sick	,
with	,
complexes	,
''	DT
;	NN
and	NN
he	NN
called	NN
David	NN

black	NN

``	NN
a	NN
fancy	NN
shvartze	NN
with	NN
a	NN

''	NN

If	,
Mr.	,
Mason	,
had	,
used	,
less	,
derogatory	DT
language	NN
to	NN
articulate	NN
his	NN
amateur	NN
analysis	NN
of	NN
the	NN
voting	NN
behavior	NN
of	NN
his	NN
fellow	NN
New	NN

,	NN
would	NN
the	NN
water	NN
be	NN
quite	NN
so	NN
hot	NN
?	NN

It	,
probably	,
would	,
,	,
because	,
few	,
or	,
none	DT
of	NN
the	NN
people	NN
upset	NN
by	NN
Mr.	NN
Mason	NN
's	NN
remarks	NN
have	NN
bothered	NN
to	NN
distinguish	NN
between	NN
the	NN
substance	NN
of	NN
his	NN
comments	NN
and	NN
the	NN
fact	NN
that	NN
he	NN
used	NN
insulting	NN
language	NN
.	NN

In	,
addition	,
,	,
some	,
of	,
Mr.	,
Mason	,
's	DT
critics	NN
have	NN
implied	NN
that	NN
his	NN
type	NN
of	NN
ethnic	NN
humor	NN
is	NN
itself	NN
a	NN
form	NN
of	NN
racism	NN
.	NN

For	,
example	,
,	,
the	,
New	,
York	,
state	,
counsel	,
for	DT
the	NN
NAACP	NN
said	NN
that	NN
Mr.	NN
Mason	NN
is	NN
``	NN
like	NN

.	NN

People	,

fast	,
leaving	,
the	,
place	,
where	,
he	DT
is	NN
stuck	NN
.	NN
''	NN

These	,
critics	,
fail	,
to	,
distinguish	,
between	,
the	,
type	DT
of	NN
ethnic	NN
humor	NN
that	NN
aims	NN
at	NN
disparaging	NN
another	NN
group	NN
,	NN
such	NN
as	NN
``	NN
Polish	NN
jokes	NN
''	NN
;	NN
and	NN
the	NN
type	NN
that	NN
is	NN
double-edged	NN
,	NN
aiming	NN
inward	NN
as	NN
well	NN
as	NN
outward	NN
.	NN

The	,
latter	,
typically	,
is	,
the	,
humor	,
of	,
the	DT
underdog	NN
,	NN
and	NN
it	NN
was	NN
perfected	NN
by	NN
both	NN
blacks	NN
and	NN
Jews	NN
on	NN
the	NN
minstrel	NN
and	NN
vaudeville	NN
stage	NN
as	NN
a	NN
means	NN
of	NN
mocking	NN
their	NN
white	NN
and	NN
gentile	NN
audiences	NN
along	NN
with	NN
themselves	NN
.	NN

In	,
the	,
hands	,
of	,
a	,
zealot	,
like	,
Lenny	,
Bruce	,
,	DT
this	NN
double-edged	NN
blade	NN
could	NN
cut	NN
both	NN
the	NN
self	NN
and	NN
the	NN
audience	NN
to	NN
ribbons	NN
.	NN

But	,
wielded	,
by	,
a	,
pro	,
like	,
Jackie	,
Mason	DT
,	NN
it	NN
is	NN
a	NN
constructive	NN
form	NN
of	NN
mischief	NN
.	NN

Why	,
constructive	,
?	,

Because	,
despite	,
all	,
the	,
media	,
prattle	,
about	,
comedy	,
and	DT
politics	NN
not	NN
mixing	NN
,	NN
they	NN
are	NN
similar	NN
in	NN
one	NN
respect	NN

Both	NN
can	NN
serve	NN
as	NN
mechanisms	NN
for	NN
easing	NN
tensions	NN
and	NN
facilitating	NN
the	NN
co-existence	NN
of	NN
groups	NN
in	NN
conflict	NN
.	NN

That	,
's	,
why	,
it	,
's	,
dangerous	DT
to	NN
have	NN
well-intentioned	NN
thought	NN

on	NN
college	NN

and	NN
elsewhere	NN
,	NN
taboo	NN
all	NN

As	,

The	,
question	,
is	,
,	,
if	,

still	DT
exist	NN
(	NN
as	NN
undeniably	NN

and	NN
if	NN
Mr.	NN

then	NN
what	NN

for	NN
letting	NN
off	NN

Do	,
n't	,

that	NN
happens	NN

in	NN
its	NN

everybody	NN

nobody	NN
,	NN
resembles	NN

more	NN
than	NN
it	NN
does	NN

It	,
is	,
true	,
that	,
the	,
best	,
sitcoms	,
do	DT
allow	NN
group	NN
differences	NN
to	NN
simmer	NN
:	NN
yuppies	NN

''	NN
;	NN
children	NN
vs.	NN

in	NN
``	NN

''	NN

But	,
these	,
are	,
not	,
the	,
differences	,
that	,
make	DT
headlines	NN
.	NN

In	,
``	,
Chicken	,

Mr.	,

plays	DT
Jackie	NN

It	,

they	,
both	,
speak	,
with	,
strong	,
accents	DT
,	NN
as	NN
do	NN
Jackie	NN

It	,
could	,

be	,
more	,
obvious	,
that	,
``	,
Chicken	DT
Soup	NN
''	NN
is	NN
being	NN
made	NN
from	NN
an	NN
old	NN
recipe	NN
.	NN

And	,
a	,
safe	,
one	,
--	,
imagine	,
if	,
the	DT
romance	NN
in	NN
question	NN
were	NN
between	NN
an	NN
Orthodox	NN
Jew	NN
and	NN
a	NN
member	NN
of	NN
the	NN
Nation	NN
of	NN
Islam	NN
.	NN

Back	,
in	,
the	,
1920s	,
,	,
the	,
play	,
and	DT
movie	NN
versions	NN
of	NN
``	NN
Abie	NN
's	NN
Irish	NN

''	NN
made	NN
the	NN
theme	NN
of	NN
courtship	NN
between	NN
the	NN
assimilated	NN
offspring	NN
of	NN
Jewish	NN
and	NN
Irish	NN
immigrants	NN
so	NN
popular	NN
that	NN
its	NN
author	NN
,	NN
Anne	NN

,	NN
lost	NN
a	NN
plagiarism	NN
suit	NN
on	NN
the	NN
grounds	NN
that	NN
the	NN
plot	NN
has	NN
entered	NN
the	NN
public	NN
domain	NN
.	NN

And	,
it	,
has	,
remained	,
there	,
,	,
as	,
evidenced	DT
by	NN
its	NN
reappearance	NN
in	NN
a	NN
1972	NN
CBS	NN
sitcom	NN
called	NN
``	NN
Bridget	NN
Loves	NN
Bernie	NN
,	NN
''	NN
whose	NN
sole	NN
distinction	NN
was	NN
that	NN
it	NN
led	NN
to	NN
the	NN
real-life	NN
marriage	NN
of	NN
Meredith	NN
Baxter	NN
and	NN
David	NN
Birney	NN
.	NN

Clearly	,
,	,
the	,
question	,
with	,
``	,
Chicken	,
Soup	DT
''	NN
is	NN
not	NN
whether	NN
the	NN
pot	NN
will	NN
boil	NN
over	NN
,	NN
but	NN
whether	NN
it	NN
will	NN
simmer	NN
at	NN
all	NN
.	NN

So	,
far	,
,	,
the	,
bubbles	,
have	,
been	,
few	,
and	DT
far	NN
between	NN
.	NN

Part	,
of	,
the	,
problem	,
is	,
the	,
tendency	,
of	,
all	DT
sitcoms	NN
,	NN
ever	NN
since	NN
the	NN
didactic	NN
days	NN
of	NN
Norman	NN
Lear	NN
,	NN
to	NN
preach	NN
about	NN
social	NN
issues	NN
.	NN

To	,
some	,
extent	,
,	,
this	,
tendency	DT
emerges	NN
whenever	NN
the	NN
show	NN
tries	NN
to	NN
enlighten	NN
us	NN
about	NN
ethnic	NN
stereotypes	NN
by	NN
reversing	NN
them	NN
.	NN

For	,
instance	,
,	,
Michael	,
dislikes	,
Jackie	,
not	,
because	DT
he	NN
's	NN
a	NN
shrewd	NN
Jewish	NN
businessman	NN
,	NN
but	NN
because	NN
he	NN
quits	NN
his	NN
well-paying	NN
job	NN
as	NN
a	NN
salesman	NN
in	NN
order	NN
to	NN
become	NN
a	NN
social	NN
worker	NN
.	NN

Even	,
more	,
problematic	,
is	,
the	,
incompatibility	,
between	,
sitcom	,
preachiness	DT
and	NN
Mr.	NN
Mason	NN
's	NN
comic	NN
persona	NN
.	NN

The	,
best	,
moments	,
in	,
the	,
show	,
occur	,
at	,
the	,
beginning	DT
and	NN
the	NN
end	NN
(	NN
and	NN
occasionally	NN
in	NN
the	NN
middle	NN
)	NN
,	NN
when	NN
Mr.	NN
Mason	NN
slips	NN
into	NN
his	NN
standup	NN
mode	NN
and	NN
starts	NN
meting	NN
out	NN
that	NN
old-fashioned	NN
Jewish	NN
mischief	NN
to	NN
other	NN
people	NN
as	NN
well	NN
as	NN
to	NN
himself	NN
.	NN

But	,
too	,
often	,
,	,
these	,
routines	,
lack	,
spark	,
because	DT
this	NN
sitcom	NN
,	NN
like	NN
all	NN
sitcoms	NN
,	NN
is	NN
timid	NN
about	NN
confronting	NN
Mr.	NN
Mason	NN
's	NN
stock	NN
in	NN
trade	NN
-	NN
ethnic	NN
differences	NN
.	NN

I	,
'm	,
not	,
suggesting	,
that	,
the	,
producers	,
start	,
putting	DT
together	NN
episodes	NN
about	NN
topics	NN
like	NN
the	NN
Catholic-Jewish	NN
dispute	NN
over	NN
the	NN
Carmelite	NN
convent	NN

.	NN

That	,
issue	,
,	,
like	,
racial	,
tensions	,
in	,

to	NN

down	NN

not	NN
heat	NN
up	NN
,	NN
before	NN
it	NN
can	NN
simmer	NN
.	NN

But	,
I	,
am	,
suggesting	,
that	,
they	,
stop	,
requiring	DT
Mr.	NN
Mason	NN
to	NN
interrupt	NN
his	NN
classic	NN

with	NN
some	NN
line	NN
about	NN
``	NN

Perhaps	,
the	,
explanation	,
for	,

that	DT

African	DT
government	NN
will	NN
be	NN
ever	NN

the	NN

The	,

The	,

Pretoria	,

In	,

the	,

that	DT
