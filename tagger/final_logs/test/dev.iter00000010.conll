Still	,

the	,

The	,
accompanying	,
table	,
shows	,
how	,
this	,

would	,
work	DT
for	NN
three	NN
stocks	NN
.	NN

Though	,
not	,
reflected	,
in	,
the	,
table	,
,	,
an	,
investor	,
should	DT
know	NN
that	NN
the	NN
cost	NN
of	NN
the	NN
option	NN
insurance	NN
can	NN
be	NN
partially	NN
offset	NN
by	NN
any	NN
dividends	NN
that	NN
the	NN
stock	NN
pays	NN
.	NN

For	,
example	,
,	,
Tenneco	,
Inc.	,
pays	,
a	DT
quarterly	NN
dividend	NN
of	NN
76	NN
cents	NN
,	NN
which	NN
would	NN
be	NN
received	NN
before	NN
the	NN
February	NN
option	NN
expires	NN
and	NN
,	NN
thus	NN
,	NN
reduce	NN
the	NN
cost	NN
of	NN
using	NN
the	NN
technique	NN
by	NN
that	NN
amount	NN
.	NN

In	,
this	,
case	,
,	,
the	,
investor	,
's	,
risk	,
would	,
n't	DT
exceed	NN
3.6	NN
%	NN

To	,
simplify	,
the	,
calculations	,
,	,
commissions	,
on	,
the	,
option	,
and	DT
underlying	NN
stock	NN
are	NN
n't	NN
included	NN
in	NN
the	NN
table	NN
.	NN

There	,
are	,
more	,
than	,
650	,
stocks	,
on	,
which	,
options	,
may	,
be	,
bought	DT
and	NN
sold	NN
,	NN
including	NN
some	NN
over-the-counter	NN
stocks	NN
.	NN

But	,
some	,
investors	,
might	,
prefer	,
a	,
simpler	,
strategy	,
then	,
hedging	DT
their	NN
individual	NN
holdings	NN
.	NN

They	,
can	,
do	,
this	,
by	,
purchasing	,
``	,
index	DT
puts	NN
,	NN
''	NN
which	NN
are	NN
simply	NN
put	NN
options	NN
on	NN
indexes	NN
that	NN
match	NN
broad	NN
baskets	NN
of	NN
stocks	NN
.	NN

For	,
instance	,
,	,
the	,
most	,
popular	,
index	,
option	,
is	,
the	DT
S&P	NN
100	NN
option	NN
,	NN
commonly	NN
called	NN
the	NN
OEX	NN
.	NN

It	,
is	,
based	,
on	,
the	,
stocks	,
that	,
make	,
up	,
Standard	DT
&	NN
Poor	NN
's	NN
100-stock	NN
index	NN
.	NN

Unlike	,
options	,
on	,
individual	,
issues	,
,	,
index	,
options	,
are	,
settled	,
only	DT
in	NN
cash	NN
,	NN
and	NN
no	NN
stock	NN
is	NN
ever	NN
tendered	NN
.	NN

But	,
while	,
index	,
options	,
are	,
convenient	,
,	,
they	,
have	,
several	DT
disadvantages	NN
.	NN

For	,
one	,
thing	,
,	,
an	,
investor	,
's	,
portfolio	,
might	,
not	,
closely	DT
match	NN
the	NN
S&P	NN
100	NN
.	NN

As	,
a	,
result	,
,	,
the	,
OEX	,
insurance	,
may	,
or	,
may	DT
not	NN
fully	NN
protect	NN
an	NN
investor	NN
's	NN
holdings	NN
in	NN
the	NN
event	NN
of	NN
a	NN
market	NN
decline	NN
.	NN

In	,
addition	,
,	,
OEX	,
options	,
were	,
suspended	,
from	,
trading	,
last	DT
Friday	NN
afternoon	NN
,	NN
after	NN
the	NN
stock-market	NN
sell-off	NN
got	NN
under	NN
way	NN
and	NN
trading	NN
in	NN
the	NN
S&P-500	NN
futures	NN
contract	NN
was	NN
halted	NN
.	NN

So	,
an	,
investor	,
who	,
wanted	,
to	,
realize	,
a	DT
profit	NN
on	NN
OEX	NN
puts	NN
after	NN
the	NN
trading	NN
suspension	NN
would	NN
have	NN
been	NN
out	NN

On	,
the	,
other	,
hand	,
,	,
only	,
a	,
handful	,
of	,
individual	,
issues	,
were	DT
suspended	NN
from	NN
trading	NN
on	NN

Normally	,
,	,
once	,
the	,

trading	,
,	DT
the	NN
options	NN
on	NN
those	NN

.	NN

Ultimately	,
,	,
whether	,
the	,
insurance	,
provided	,
by	,
purchasing	,
puts	DT
is	NN
worthwhile	NN
depends	NN
on	NN
the	NN
cost	NN
of	NN
the	NN
options	NN
.	NN

That	,
cost	,
rises	,
in	,
times	,
of	,
high	,
market	,
volatility	DT
.	NN

But	,
it	,
still	,
might	,
be	,
cheaper	,
than	,
taking	,
a	DT
major	NN
hit	NN
.	NN

The	,
protection	,
from	,
using	,

is	DT
clearly	NN
superior	NN
to	NN
that	NN
afforded	NN
by	NN
another	NN

using	NN
during	NN
troubled	NN
times	NN
:	NN
selling	NN
call	NN
options	NN
on	NN

the	NN
investor	NN

A	,
call	,
option	,
is	,
similar	,
to	,
a	DT
put	NN
,	NN
except	NN
that	NN
it	NN
gives	NN

the	NN
right	NN

at	NN
a	NN

price	NN
until	NN

Selling	,
a	,

option	,
gives	,
an	,
investor	,
a	,
small	DT
buffer	NN
against	NN
a	NN
stock-market	NN
decline	NN
.	NN

That	,
's	,
because	,
it	,
reduces	,
the	,

of	DT

the	,

was	NN
to	NN
make	NN
his	NN
point	NN
that	NN
Americans	NN
have	NN
rights	NN
as	NN
individuals	NN
,	NN
not	NN
as	NN
members	NN

criticized	,

``	,

Mr.	,

which	NN
somehow	NN
elevated	NN
the	NN

It	,

Yet	,
it	,
is	,

axiomatic	,
that	DT
the	NN
power	NN

new	NN
crimes	NN
belongs	NN
only	NN
to	NN
the	NN
legislature	NN
,	NN
and	NN
not	NN
to	NN

Beginning	,
in	,
the	,
early	,
19th	,
century	,
,	DT
with	NN
U.S.	NN
v.	NN
Hudson	NN
and	NN
Goodwin	NN
,	NN
the	NN
Supreme	NN
Court	NN
has	NN
repeatedly	NN
held	NN
that	NN
a	NN
judicial	NN
power	NN
to	NN
declare	NN
conduct	NN
to	NN
be	NN
against	NN
the	NN
public	NN
interest	NN
and	NN
hence	NN
criminal	NN
,	NN
while	NN
well	NN
established	NN

would	NN
usurp	NN
legislative	NN
authority	NN
under	NN
the	NN
doctrine	NN
of	NN
separation	NN
of	NN
powers	NN
.	NN

That	,
's	,
the	,
conventional	,
theory	,
anyway	,

In	,
practice	,
,	,
however	,
,	,
the	,
line	DT
between	NN
interpretation	NN

redefinition	NN
of	NN
the	NN

long	NN

began	NN
to	NN
blur	NN

In	,
particular	,
,	,
a	,
common	,
law	,

white-collar	,
crime	DT
has	NN
developed	NN
with	NN
surprising	NN
rapidity	NN
over	NN
the	NN
past	NN
decade	NN

For	,
example	,
,	,
although	,
insider	,

has	,
long	DT
been	NN
criminal	NN
,	NN
it	NN
has	NN
never	NN
been	NN
statutorily	NN
defined	NN
.	NN

In	,
1983	,
,	,
the	,
Supreme	,
Court	,
tried	DT
to	NN
supply	NN
a	NN
workable	NN
definition	NN
in	NN
the	NN
Dirks	NN
v.	NN
SEC	NN
decision	NN
,	NN
which	NN
found	NN
that	NN
liability	NN
depended	NN
on	NN
whether	NN
the	NN
tipper	NN
had	NN
breached	NN
his	NN
fiduciary	NN
duty	NN
to	NN
the	NN
corporation	NN
in	NN

and	NN
whether	NN
the	NN
tippee	NN
knew	NN

disregarded	NN
this	NN
fact	NN

Gradually	,
,	,
however	,
,	,
lower	,

have	NN
pushed	NN
this	NN

to	NN
its	NN

Basically	,

Mr.	,

fourth-level	DT
tippee	NN

Did	,
Mr.	,

Or	,
did	,

hear	DT
a	NN

rumor	NN
(	NN
which	NN

The	,

purposes	NN

A	,
second	,
illustration	,
is	,
supplied	,
by	,
the	DT
recent	NN
guilty	NN
plea	NN
entered	NN

Robert	NN
Freeman	NN
,	NN
formerly	NN
head	NN
of	NN
arbitrage	NN
at	NN
Goldman	NN

Essentially	,
,	,
Mr.	,
Freeman	,
had	,
invested	,
heavily	,
in	,
the	,
Beatrice	,
leveraged	DT
buy-out	NN
,	NN
when	NN
he	NN
was	NN
told	NN

``	NN

that	NN
the	NN

After	,
placing	,
orders	,
to	,

,	,
Mr.	,
Freeman	,
called	,
Martin	DT
Siegel	NN
,	NN
an	NN

at	NN
Kidder	NN

Peabody	NN

who	NN
was	NN
advising	NN
on	NN
the	NN

to	NN
confirm	NN
these	NN

Mr.	,
Siegel	,
asked	,
Mr.	,
Freeman	,
who	,
his	,
source	,
was	DT
and	NN
,	NN
on	NN
hearing	NN
that	NN
it	NN

responded	NN

``	NN
Well	NN

your	NN

''	NN

The	,
illegal	,
``	,
tip	,
''	,
of	,
the	,
bunny	DT
's	NN
good	NN
nose	NN
was	NN
then	NN
largely	NN
a	NN
confirmation	NN
of	NN
rumors	NN
already	NN
known	NN
to	NN
many	NN
in	NN
the	NN
market	NN

Had	,
the	,
case	,
gone	,
to	,
trial	,
the	,

issues	,
would	DT
have	NN
surfaced	NN
:	NN

Was	,
there	,
a	,
fiduciary	,
breach	,
in	DT
order	NN
to	NN
obtain	NN
personal	NN
gain	NN
?	NN

Did	,
Mr.	,
Freeman	,
have	,
notice	,
of	,
this	,
?	DT

Finally	,
,	,
was	,
the	,
information	,
material	,
?	,

Yet	,
,	,
all	,
these	,
issues	,
are	,
subsidiary	,
to	,
a	DT
more	NN
central	NN
issue	NN
:	NN
Who	NN
is	NN
and	NN
who	NN
should	NN
be	NN
making	NN
the	NN
criminal	NN
law	NN
here	NN
?	NN

It	,
is	,
not	,
my	,
contention	,
that	,
either	,
Mr.	DT
Chestman	NN
or	NN
Mr.	NN
Freeman	NN
was	NN
an	NN
innocent	NN
victim	NN
of	NN
prosecutorial	NN
overzealousness	NN
.	NN

Arguably	,
,	,
both	,
were	,
on	,
notice	,
that	,
their	DT
behavior	NN
was	NN
at	NN
least	NN
risky	NN
.	NN

But	,
even	,
if	,
they	,
behaved	,
recklessly	,
,	DT
reasons	NN
still	NN
exist	NN
to	NN
fear	NN
and	NN
resist	NN
this	NN
steady	NN
process	NN
of	NN
case-by-case	NN
judicial	NN
extension	NN
of	NN
the	NN
law	NN
of	NN
insider	NN
trading	NN

Courts	,
and	,
legislatures	,
make	,
decisions	,
in	,
very	,
different	,
ways	,
and	DT
are	NN
each	NN
susceptible	NN
to	NN
very	NN
different	NN
kinds	NN
of	NN
errors	NN
.	NN

After-the-fact	,
judicial	,
examination	,
of	,
an	,
actor	,
's	,
conduct	,
has	DT
always	NN
been	NN
the	NN
common	NN
law	NN
's	NN
method	NN
.	NN

When	,
only	,
civil	,
liability	,
is	,
involved	,
,	DT
this	NN
method	NN
has	NN
the	NN
undeniable	NN
strengths	NN
of	NN
factual	NN
specificity	NN
and	NN
avoidance	NN
of	NN
overgeneralization	NN
.	NN

Still	,
,	,
case-by-case	,
retrospective	,
decision	,
making	,
of	DT
this	NN
sort	NN
is	NN
vulnerable	NN
to	NN
the	NN
tunnel	NN
vision	NN
caused	NN
by	NN
a	NN
fixation	NN
on	NN
ad	NN
hoc	NN
(	NN
and	NN
usually	NN
sleazy	NN
)	NN
examples	NN
.	NN

When	,
a	,
court	,
decides	,
that	,
a	,
particular	,
actor	DT
's	NN
conduct	NN
was	NN
culpable	NN
and	NN
so	NN
extends	NN
the	NN
definition	NN
of	NN
insider	NN
trading	NN
to	NN
reach	NN
this	NN
conduct	NN
,	NN
it	NN
does	NN
not	NN
see	NN
the	NN
potentially	NN
enormous	NN
number	NN
of	NN
other	NN
cases	NN
that	NN
will	NN
be	NN
covered	NN
by	NN
the	NN
expanded	NN
rule	NN

Thus	,
,	,
a	,
court	,
is	,
poorly	DT
positioned	NN
to	NN
make	NN
judgments	NN
about	NN
the	NN
social	NN
utility	NN
of	NN
the	NN
expanded	NN
rule	NN

For	,

in	,
focusing	,
on	,
Mr.	,

's	NN
attempt	NN
to	NN
gain	NN
nonpublic	NN
information	NN

does	NN
not	NN
naturally	NN
think	NN
about	NN
the	NN
reverse	NN
side	NN
of	NN
the	NN
coin	NN
:	NN
What	NN
if	NN
the	NN
rumor	NN
had	NN
been	NN
false	NN
?	NN

Can	,
a	,
security	,

to	DT
make	NN
certain	NN
that	NN
a	NN
seemingly	NN
improbable	NN
rumor	NN
is	NN
in	NN
fact	NN
false	NN
?	NN

In	,
the	,
past	,
,	,
not	,
only	,
would	,
reputable	,
professionals	DT
have	NN
rushed	NN
to	NN
check	NN
out	NN
such	NN
rumors	NN
with	NN
the	NN
company	NN
,	NN
but	NN
companies	NN
listed	NN
on	NN
the	NN
major	NN
stock	NN

encouraged	NN
by	NN
the	NN
exchanges	NN
to	NN
respond	NN
openly	NN
to	NN
such	NN
inquiries	NN
from	NN
securities	NN
analysts	NN
.	NN

Today	,
,	,
after	,
Mr.	,
Freeman	,

plea	,

there	NN
is	NN
an	NN
uncertainty	NN
that	NN
is	NN
both	NN
unfair	NN
and	NN
inefficient	NN
.	NN

In	,
this	,
light	,

comparative	,
advantages	,

legislative	,
law-making	DT
become	NN
clear	NN
:	NN
(	NN
1	NN
)	NN
Before	NN

the	NN
legislature	NN

the	NN

the	NN

standards	NN
that	NN

than	NN
the	NN

Although	,

Yet	,

The	,

has	,
never	,

to	,
woo	,
advertisers	,
with	DT
quite	NN
so	NN
much	NN
fervor	NN
before	NN

largely	,
rested	,

The	,

had	,
its	,
best	,
year	,
yet	,
in	,
1988	DT

when	NN
it	NN
celebrated	NN

died	NN

too	NN
did	NN
some	NN
advertiser	NN
interest	NN

The	,
reason	,
,	,
ad	,

say	,
,	,
is	,
that	,
the	DT

has	NN
some	NN

Perhaps	,
the	,

When	,

are	,
tight	,

the	,
high	,

cost	,
is	DT
a	NN
major	NN

To	,
combat	,
that	,
problem	,
,	,
National	,

,	,
like	,
other	,

began	,

the	,

come	NN
up	NN
