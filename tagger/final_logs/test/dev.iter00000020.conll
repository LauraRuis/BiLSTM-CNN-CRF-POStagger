he	NN

Reasons	NN
for	NN
the	NN
collapse	NN
of	NN
the	NN
Nimitz	NN
Freeway	NN
were	NN
sketchy	NN
yesterday	NN
.	NN

But	NN
most	NN
structural	NN
engineers	NN
attributed	NN
the	NN
destruction	NN
to	NN
improper	NN
reinforcement	NN
of	NN
the	NN
columns	NN
that	NN
supported	NN
the	NN
decks	NN
,	NN
and	NN
the	NN
fact	NN
that	NN
the	NN
ground	NN
beneath	NN
the	NN
highway	NN
is	NN
largely	NN
landfill	NN
and	NN
can	NN
become	NN
unstable	NN
,	NN
or	NN
``	NN
liquefy	NN
,	NN
''	NN
in	NN
a	NN
major	NN
quake	NN
.	NN

The	NN
two-story	NN
roadway	NN
,	NN
designed	NN
in	NN
the	NN
mid-1940s	NN
and	NN
completed	NN
in	NN
1957	NN
,	NN
was	NN
supported	NN
by	NN
columns	NN
that	NN
apparently	NN
lacked	NN
the	NN
kind	NN
of	NN
steel	NN
reinforcement	NN
used	NN
in	NN
highways	NN
today	NN
.	NN

While	NN
the	NN
pillars	NN
did	NN
have	NN
long	NN
metal	NN
bars	NN
running	NN
vertically	NN
through	NN
them	NN
for	NN
reinforcement	NN
,	NN
they	NN
apparently	NN
lacked	NN
an	NN
adequate	NN
number	NN
of	NN
metal	NN
``	NN
ties	NN
''	NN
that	NN
run	NN
horizontally	NN
through	NN
the	NN
column	NN

said	NN
Leo	NN
Parker	NN
,	NN
a	NN
structural	NN
engineer	NN
in	NN
Los	NN

Caltrans	NN
today	NN
uses	NN
a	NN
variation	NN
of	NN
the	NN
design	NN
Mr.	NN
Parker	NN
describes	NN
,	NN
with	NN
spiraling	NN
steel	NN
rods	NN
inside	NN

But	NN
in	NN
the	NN
case	NN
of	NN
the	NN
Nimitz	NN
Freeway	NN
,	NN
the	NN
lack	NN
of	NN
such	NN
support	NN
caused	NN
the	NN
core	NN
of	NN
the	NN
columns	NN
to	NN
crumble	NN
and	NN
buckle	NN
under	NN
the	NN
weight	NN
of	NN
the	NN
second	NN
deck	NN

crushing	NN

Officials	NN
of	NN
the	NN
state	NN
agency	NN
did	NN
n't	NN
have	NN
any	NN
immediate	NN
explanation	NN
why	NN
the	NN
reinforcement	NN
did	NN
n't	NN
hold	NN
up	NN

Caltrans	NN
reinforced	NN
the	NN
highway	NN
in	NN
1977	NN
as	NN
part	NN
of	NN
a	NN
$	NN
55	NN

cables	NN
to	NN
tie	NN
the	NN

the	NN

to	NN
the	NN
columns	NN
and	NN
prevent	NN
the	NN
structure	NN
from	NN
swaying	NN
in	NN
a	NN
quake	NN
.	NN

Caltrans	NN
spokesman	NN
Jim	NN

Sacramento	NN
declined	NN
to	NN
identify	NN
the	NN
engineering	NN
firm	NN
that	NN
did	NN
the	NN
reinforcement	NN
work	NN
.	NN

Liability	NN
in	NN
the	NN
bridge	NN
and	NN
road	NN
collapses	NN
will	NN
revolve	NN
around	NN
whether	NN
government	NN
took	NN

about	NN

``	NN
it	NN

two	NN

Republican	NN
Sen.	NN
Arlen	NN
Specter	NN
of	NN
Pennsylvania	NN
engaged	NN
the	NN
nominee	NN
in	NN
a	NN
verbal	NN
contest	NN
aimed	NN
at	NN
showing	NN
that	NN
Mr.	NN

was	NN
willing	NN
to	NN
stretch	NN
the	NN

in	NN
one	NN
area	NN
(	NN

)	NN
while	NN
remaining	NN
rigid	NN
in	NN
all	NN
the	NN
others	NN

It	NN
achieved	NN
a	NN
good	NN
media	NN
play	NN
,	NN
and	NN
enabled	NN
Sen.	NN
Specter	NN
and	NN
others	NN
to	NN
vote	NN
against	NN
Mr.	NN
Bork	NN
out	NN
of	NN
``	NN

''	NN

Further	NN
ammunition	NN
came	NN
from	NN

theorist	NN
Ronald	NN
Dworkin	NN
,	NN
who	NN
in	NN
the	NN

the	NN
Constitution	NN
,	NN
particularly	NN
in	NN
the	NN

of	NN
``	NN

''	NN

The	NN
charge	NN
of	NN
being	NN
``	NN

''	NN
of	NN
legal	NN
thought	NN
gravely	NN
undercut	NN
Mr.	NN

him	NN

on	NN
the	NN

The	NN
upshot	NN
?	NN

Mr.	NN
Bork	NN
's	NN
opponents	NN
chose	NN
the	NN
battlefield	NN
,	NN
held	NN
it	NN
and	NN
kept	NN
it	NN
.	NN

Yet	NN
with	NN
the	NN
smooth	NN
confirmation	NN
of	NN
Anthony	NN
Kennedy	NN
,	NN
an	NN
``	NN
80	NN
percenter	NN
''	NN
only	NN
slightly	NN
less	NN
supportive	NN

restraint	NN
than	NN
Mr.	NN
Bork	NN
,	NN
the	NN
Democrats	NN
may	NN
have	NN
won	NN
the	NN
battle	NN
but	NN
lost	NN
the	NN
war	NN
.	NN

Another	NN
upshot	NN
,	NN
however	NN
,	NN
was	NN
the	NN
chilling	NN
message	NN
the	NN
Bork	NN
hearings	NN
sent	NN
into	NN
the	NN
judicial	NN
culture	NN
from	NN
which	NN
the	NN
Supreme	NN
Court	NN
draws	NN
its	NN
talent	NN
.	NN

The	NN
word	NN
went	NN
forth	NN
to	NN
every	NN
law	NN
school	NN
that	NN
those	NN
with	NN
federal	NN
court	NN
ambitions	NN
must	NN
travel	NN
a	NN
safe	NN
constitutional	NN
journey	NN
,	NN
with	NN
no	NN
paper	NN
trail	NN
and	NN
no	NN
bite	NN
to	NN
their	NN
tongue	NN
or	NN
pen	NN
.	NN

Unfortunately	NN
,	NN
the	NN
author	NN
simply	NN
does	NN
n't	NN
supply	NN
the	NN
philosophical	NN
frame	NN
to	NN
sustain	NN
his	NN
reportorial	NN
talents	NN

He	NN
has	NN
too	NN
readily	NN
swallowed	NN
the	NN
case	NN
for	NN
the	NN
activist	NN
law	NN
school	NN

Probing	NN
more	NN
deeply	NN
into	NN
the	NN
doctrine	NN
of	NN
``	NN
judicial	NN
restraint	NN
,	NN
''	NN
he	NN
would	NN
have	NN
found	NN
a	NN
long	NN
history	NN
going	NN
back	NN
to	NN
the	NN
great	NN
decisions	NN
of	NN
Justice	NN
Holmes	NN
.	NN

He	NN
would	NN
discover	NN
it	NN
also	NN
in	NN
Alexander	NN

,	NN
a	NN
subtle	NN
constitutional	NN
scholar	NN
,	NN
Mr.	NN
Bork	NN
's	NN
closest	NN
friend	NN
at	NN
Yale	NN

whose	NN
influence	NN
on	NN
the	NN
judge	NN
goes	NN
well	NN
beyond	NN
Mr.	NN
Bronner	NN

reporting	NN
.	NN

Still	NN
,	NN
the	NN
long	NN
view	NN
of	NN
Robert	NN
Bork	NN
as	NN
constitutional	NN
thinker	NN
must	NN
be	NN
a	NN
spotty	NN
one	NN
.	NN

His	NN
strength	NN
lies	NN
in	NN
his	NN
majoritarian	NN
doctrine	NN
,	NN
which	NN
keeps	NN
the	NN
Court	NN
clear	NN
of	NN
transient	NN
group	NN
pressures	NN
and	NN
leaves	NN
most	NN
decisions	NN
in	NN
a	NN
democracy	NN
to	NN
elected	NN
legislatures	NN
and	NN
executives	NN
.	NN

Unfortunately	NN
,	NN
Mr.	NN
Bork	NN
failed	NN
to	NN
distinguish	NN
between	NN
such	NN
pressures	NN
and	NN
the	NN
emergence	NN
of	NN
great	NN
issues	NN
critical	NN
to	NN
a	NN
society	NN
that	NN
must	NN
be	NN
settled	NN
judicially	NN
if	NN
it	NN
is	NN
to	NN
cohere	NN

question	NN
of	NN

issue	NN

the	NN
chaos	NN

One	NN
can	NN
understand	NN
Mr.	NN

's	NN
fear	NN
that	NN
the	NN
new	NN
right	NN
to	NN
privacy	NN
will	NN
become	NN
intolerably	NN

Sen.	NN

argument	NN

that	NN
a	NN

would	NN
be	NN
bad	NN
for	NN
the	NN

would	NN

increase	NN

push	NN
up	NN

The	NN
counter-argument	NN
,	NN
which	NN
he	NN
has	NN
heard	NN

is	NN
that	NN
if	NN
he	NN

his	NN
fellow	NN

successful	NN
in	NN
killing	NN
the	NN

the	NN

will	NN
open	NN
up	NN
tremendously	NN
in	NN

because	NN

the	NN

recommend	NN
using	NN

all	NN
the	NN
time	NN

price	NN
of	NN

will	NN
increase	NN

gain	NN

match	NN
the	NN

on	NN
the	NN
stock	NN

The	NN
put	NN
establishes	NN
a	NN
minimum	NN
selling	NN
price	NN
for	NN
the	NN
stock	NN
during	NN
its	NN
life	NN

When	NN
a	NN
stock	NN
falls	NN
below	NN
the	NN
put	NN

strike	NN
price	NN

the	NN
investor	NN

sells	NN

by	NN
tendering	NN
the	NN
stock	NN
to	NN
his	NN

The	NN
accompanying	NN
table	NN
shows	NN
how	NN
this	NN
strategy	NN
would	NN
work	NN
for	NN
three	NN
stocks	NN
.	NN

Though	NN
not	NN
reflected	NN
in	NN
the	NN
table	NN
,	NN
an	NN
investor	NN
should	NN
know	NN
that	NN
the	NN
cost	NN
of	NN
the	NN
option	NN
insurance	NN
can	NN
be	NN
partially	NN
offset	NN
by	NN
any	NN
dividends	NN
that	NN
the	NN
stock	NN
pays	NN
.	NN

For	NN
example	NN
,	NN
Tenneco	NN
Inc.	NN
pays	NN
a	NN
quarterly	NN
dividend	NN
of	NN
76	NN
cents	NN
,	NN
which	NN
would	NN
be	NN
received	NN
before	NN
the	NN
February	NN
option	NN
expires	NN
and	NN
,	NN
thus	NN
,	NN
reduce	NN
the	NN
cost	NN
of	NN
using	NN
the	NN
technique	NN
by	NN
that	NN
amount	NN
.	NN

In	NN
this	NN
case	NN
,	NN
the	NN
investor	NN
's	NN
risk	NN
would	NN
n't	NN
exceed	NN
3.6	NN
%	NN
of	NN
the	NN
total	NN
investment	NN
.	NN

To	NN
simplify	NN
the	NN
calculations	NN
,	NN
commissions	NN
on	NN
the	NN
option	NN
and	NN
underlying	NN
stock	NN
are	NN
n't	NN
included	NN
in	NN
the	NN
table	NN
.	NN

There	NN
are	NN
more	NN
than	NN
650	NN
stocks	NN
on	NN
which	NN
options	NN
may	NN
be	NN
bought	NN
and	NN
sold	NN
,	NN
including	NN
some	NN
over-the-counter	NN
stocks	NN
.	NN

But	NN
some	NN
investors	NN
might	NN
prefer	NN
a	NN
simpler	NN
strategy	NN
then	NN
hedging	NN
their	NN
individual	NN
holdings	NN
.	NN

They	NN
can	NN
do	NN
this	NN
by	NN
purchasing	NN
``	NN
index	NN
puts	NN
,	NN
''	NN
which	NN
are	NN
simply	NN
put	NN
options	NN
on	NN
indexes	NN
that	NN
match	NN
broad	NN
baskets	NN
of	NN
stocks	NN
.	NN

For	NN
instance	NN
,	NN
the	NN
most	NN
popular	NN
index	NN
option	NN
is	NN
the	NN
S&P	NN
100	NN
option	NN
,	NN
commonly	NN
called	NN
the	NN
OEX	NN
.	NN

It	NN
is	NN
based	NN
on	NN
the	NN
stocks	NN
that	NN
make	NN
up	NN
Standard	NN
&	NN
Poor	NN
's	NN
100-stock	NN
index	NN
.	NN

Unlike	NN
options	NN
on	NN
individual	NN
issues	NN
,	NN
index	NN
options	NN
are	NN
settled	NN
only	NN
in	NN
cash	NN
,	NN
and	NN
no	NN
stock	NN
is	NN
ever	NN
tendered	NN
.	NN

But	NN
while	NN
index	NN
options	NN
are	NN
convenient	NN
,	NN
they	NN
have	NN
several	NN
disadvantages	NN
.	NN

For	NN
one	NN
thing	NN
,	NN
an	NN
investor	NN
's	NN
portfolio	NN
might	NN
not	NN
closely	NN
match	NN
the	NN
S&P	NN
100	NN
.	NN

As	NN
a	NN
result	NN
,	NN
the	NN
OEX	NN
insurance	NN
may	NN
or	NN
may	NN
not	NN
fully	NN
protect	NN
an	NN
investor	NN
's	NN
holdings	NN
in	NN
the	NN
event	NN
of	NN
a	NN
market	NN
decline	NN
.	NN

In	NN
addition	NN
,	NN
OEX	NN
options	NN
were	NN
suspended	NN
from	NN
trading	NN
last	NN
Friday	NN
afternoon	NN
,	NN
after	NN
the	NN
stock-market	NN
sell-off	NN
got	NN
under	NN
way	NN
and	NN
trading	NN
in	NN
the	NN
S&P-500	NN
futures	NN
contract	NN
was	NN
halted	NN
.	NN

So	NN
an	NN
investor	NN
who	NN
wanted	NN
to	NN
realize	NN
a	NN
profit	NN
on	NN
OEX	NN
puts	NN
after	NN
the	NN
trading	NN
suspension	NN
would	NN
have	NN
been	NN
out	NN
of	NN
luck	NN
.	NN

On	NN
the	NN
other	NN
hand	NN
,	NN
only	NN
a	NN
handful	NN
of	NN
individual	NN
issues	NN
were	NN
suspended	NN
from	NN
trading	NN
on	NN
Friday	NN
.	NN

Normally	NN
,	NN
once	NN
the	NN
underlying	NN
investment	NN
is	NN
suspended	NN
from	NN
trading	NN
,	NN
the	NN
options	NN
on	NN
those	NN
investments	NN
also	NN
do	NN
n't	NN
trade	NN
.	NN

Ultimately	NN
,	NN
whether	NN
the	NN
insurance	NN
provided	NN
by	NN
purchasing	NN
puts	NN
is	NN
worthwhile	NN
depends	NN
on	NN
the	NN
cost	NN
of	NN
the	NN
options	NN
.	NN

That	NN
cost	NN
rises	NN
in	NN
times	NN
of	NN
high	NN
market	NN
volatility	NN
.	NN

But	NN
it	NN
still	NN
might	NN
be	NN
cheaper	NN
than	NN
taking	NN
a	NN
major	NN
hit	NN
.	NN

The	NN
protection	NN
from	NN
using	NN
married	NN
puts	NN
is	NN
clearly	NN
superior	NN
to	NN
that	NN
afforded	NN
by	NN
another	NN
options	NN
strategy	NN
some	NN
investors	NN
consider	NN
using	NN
during	NN
troubled	NN
times	NN
:	NN
selling	NN
call	NN
options	NN
on	NN
stocks	NN
the	NN
investor	NN
owns	NN
.	NN

A	NN
call	NN
option	NN
is	NN
similar	NN
to	NN
a	NN
put	NN
,	NN
except	NN
that	NN
it	NN
gives	NN
its	NN
owner	NN
the	NN
right	NN
to	NN
buy	NN
shares	NN
at	NN
a	NN
stated	NN
price	NN
until	NN
expiration	NN
.	NN

Selling	NN
a	NN
call	NN
option	NN
gives	NN
an	NN
investor	NN
a	NN
small	NN
buffer	NN
against	NN
a	NN
stock-market	NN
decline	NN
.	NN

That	NN
's	NN
because	NN
it	NN
reduces	NN
the	NN
cost	NN
of	NN

not	NN
that	NN
the	NN
resistance	NN
has	NN
failed	NN

to	NN
being	NN
taken	NN
back	NN

He	NN
says	NN
the	NN
title	NN
of	NN
his	NN
speech	NN
was	NN
to	NN
make	NN
his	NN
point	NN
that	NN
Americans	NN
have	NN
rights	NN
as	NN
individuals	NN
,	NN
not	NN
as	NN
members	NN
of	NN
certain	NN
select	NN
groups	NN

His	NN
speech	NN
criticized	NN
the	NN
``	NN
idiocy	NN
of	NN
notions	NN

Mr.	NN

The	NN
three	NN
most	NN
important	NN
things	NN
to	NN
understand	NN
about	NN
Mr.	NN

is	NN
that	NN
he	NN
is	NN
a	NN
black	NN
conservative	NN
intellectual	NN
--	NN
a	NN
triple	NN
threat	NN
to	NN
the	NN
liberal	NN
establishment	NN

Mr.	NN
Allen	NN
,	NN
who	NN
teaches	NN
government	NN
at	NN

Harvey	NN

College	NN
in	NN
California	NN
and	NN
will	NN
remain	NN
a	NN
member	NN

commission	NN
,	NN
has	NN
spent	NN
years	NN
arguing	NN
that	NN
civil	NN
rights	NN
are	NN
individuals	NN
'	NN
rights	NN
.	NN

He	NN
last	NN
made	NN
waves	NN
when	NN
he	NN
dared	NN
to	NN
defend	NN
an	NN
Indian	NN
girl	NN
who	NN
had	NN
been	NN
adopted	NN
by	NN
non-Indian	NN
parents	NN
off	NN
her	NN
reservation	NN
.	NN

Mr.	NN
Allen	NN
quickly	NN
ran	NN
up	NN
against	NN
the	NN
liberal	NN
establishment	NN
again	NN
,	NN
which	NN
somehow	NN
elevated	NN
the	NN
vague	NN
concept	NN
of	NN
``	NN
Indian	NN
rights	NN
''	NN
above	NN
the	NN
rights	NN
of	NN
individual	NN
Indians	NN
.	NN

There	NN
is	NN
a	NN
huge	NN
divide	NN
between	NN
Mr.	NN
Allen	NN
's	NN
we're-all-in-this-together	NN
view	NN
and	NN
the	NN
divisive	NN
litigation	NN
approach	NN
of	NN
the	NN
civil	NN
rights	NN
groups	NN
.	NN

Indeed	NN
,	NN
the	NN
gap	NN
is	NN
so	NN
large	NN
that	NN
Mr.	NN
Allen	NN
's	NN
critics	NN
refuse	NN
to	NN
engage	NN
the	NN
debate	NN

Their	NN
ridicule	NN
of	NN

substitute	NN

argument	NN

Their	NN
effort	NN
to	NN

It	NN
is	NN
now	NN
a	NN
commonplace	NN
that	NN
prosecutors	NN
are	NN
bringing	NN
criminal	NN
indictments	NN
in	NN
cases	NN
where	NN
until	NN
a	NN

years	NN

only	NN
a	NN
civil	NN
action	NN
at	NN
most	NN
would	NN
have	NN
been	NN
brought	NN

Yet	NN
it	NN
is	NN
also	NN
axiomatic	NN
that	NN
the	NN
power	NN
to	NN
create	NN
new	NN
crimes	NN
belongs	NN
only	NN
to	NN
the	NN
legislature	NN
,	NN
and	NN
not	NN
to	NN

.	NN

Beginning	NN
in	NN
the	NN
early	NN
19th	NN
century	NN
,	NN
with	NN
U.S.	NN
v.	NN
Hudson	NN
and	NN
Goodwin	NN
,	NN
the	NN
Supreme	NN
Court	NN
has	NN
repeatedly	NN
held	NN
that	NN
a	NN
judicial	NN
power	NN
to	NN
declare	NN
conduct	NN
to	NN
be	NN
against	NN
the	NN
public	NN
interest	NN
and	NN
hence	NN
criminal	NN
,	NN
while	NN
well	NN
established	NN
in	NN
British	NN
law	NN
,	NN
would	NN
usurp	NN
legislative	NN
authority	NN
under	NN
the	NN
doctrine	NN
of	NN
separation	NN
of	NN
powers	NN
.	NN

That	NN
's	NN
the	NN
conventional	NN
theory	NN
anyway	NN
.	NN

In	NN
practice	NN
,	NN
however	NN
,	NN
the	NN
line	NN
between	NN
interpretation	NN
and	NN
redefinition	NN
of	NN
the	NN
criminal	NN
law	NN
long	NN
ago	NN
began	NN
to	NN
blur	NN
.	NN

In	NN
particular	NN
,	NN
a	NN
common	NN
law	NN
of	NN
white-collar	NN
crime	NN
has	NN
developed	NN
with	NN
surprising	NN
rapidity	NN
over	NN
the	NN
past	NN
decade	NN
.	NN

For	NN
example	NN
,	NN
although	NN
insider	NN
trading	NN
has	NN
long	NN
been	NN
criminal	NN
,	NN
it	NN
has	NN
never	NN
been	NN
statutorily	NN
defined	NN
.	NN

In	NN
1983	NN
,	NN
the	NN
Supreme	NN
Court	NN
tried	NN
to	NN
supply	NN
a	NN
workable	NN
definition	NN
in	NN
the	NN
Dirks	NN
v.	NN
SEC	NN
decision	NN
,	NN
which	NN
found	NN
that	NN
liability	NN
depended	NN
on	NN
whether	NN
the	NN
tipper	NN
had	NN
breached	NN
his	NN
fiduciary	NN
duty	NN
to	NN
the	NN
corporation	NN
in	NN
order	NN
to	NN
obtain	NN
``	NN
some	NN
personal	NN
gain	NN
''	NN
and	NN
whether	NN
the	NN
tippee	NN
knew	NN
or	NN
recklessly	NN
disregarded	NN
this	NN
fact	NN
.	NN

Gradually	NN
,	NN
however	NN
,	NN
lower	NN
courts	NN
and	NN
prosecutors	NN
have	NN
pushed	NN
this	NN
definition	NN
to	NN
its	NN
breaking	NN
point	NN
.	NN

Consider	NN
the	NN
facts	NN
underlying	NN
the	NN
1989	NN
conviction	NN
of	NN
Robert	NN
Chestman	NN
.	NN

Prior	NN
to	NN
a	NN
tender	NN

by	NN

Waldbaum	NN

in	NN
1986	NN

the	NN

who	NN
,	NN
in	NN

persuaded	NN
her	NN
husband	NN

a	NN
Mr.	NN
Loeb	NN

to	NN
run	NN
this	NN
errand	NN
.	NN

Hearing	NN
of	NN
this	NN
information	NN
,	NN
the	NN
husband	NN
discussed	NN
it	NN
with	NN
his	NN
broker	NN
,	NN
Mr.	NN
Chestman	NN

and	NN
Mr.	NN
Chestman	NN
then	NN
bought	NN
for	NN
his	NN
own	NN

and	NN
other	NN
clients	NN
.	NN

Basically	NN
,	NN
Mr.	NN
Chestman	NN
was	NN
a	NN
fourth-level	NN
tippee	NN
.	NN

Did	NN
Mr.	NN
Loeb	NN
,	NN
his	NN
tipper	NN
,	NN
breach	NN
a	NN
fiduciary	NN
duty	NN
(	NN
and	NN

if	NN
so	NN

to	NN
whom	NN

Did	NN
Mr.	NN
Loeb	NN
seek	NN
personal	NN
gain	NN
(	NN
and	NN
if	NN
so	NN
,	NN
how	NN
)	NN
?	NN

Or	NN
did	NN
Mr.	NN
Chestman	NN
only	NN
hear	NN
a	NN
market	NN
rumor	NN
(	NN
which	NN
one	NN
may	NN
lawfully	NN

upon	NN
)	NN
?	NN

The	NN
line	NN
seems	NN
awfully	NN
thin	NN
for	NN
criminal-law	NN
purposes	NN
.	NN

A	NN
second	NN
illustration	NN
is	NN
supplied	NN
by	NN
the	NN
recent	NN
guilty	NN
plea	NN
entered	NN
by	NN
Robert	NN
Freeman	NN
,	NN
formerly	NN
head	NN
of	NN
arbitrage	NN
at	NN
Goldman	NN
,	NN
Sachs	NN
&	NN
Co	NN
.	NN

Essentially	NN
,	NN
Mr.	NN
Freeman	NN
had	NN
invested	NN
heavily	NN
in	NN
the	NN
Beatrice	NN
leveraged	NN
buy-out	NN
,	NN
when	NN
he	NN
was	NN
told	NN
by	NN
another	NN
prominent	NN
trader	NN
,	NN
Bernard	NN
``	NN
Bunny	NN
''	NN
Lasker	NN
,	NN
that	NN
the	NN
deal	NN
was	NN
in	NN
trouble	NN
.	NN

After	NN
placing	NN
orders	NN
to	NN
sell	NN
,	NN
Mr.	NN
Freeman	NN
called	NN
Martin	NN
Siegel	NN
,	NN
an	NN
investment	NN
banker	NN
at	NN
Kidder	NN
,	NN
Peabody	NN
&	NN
Co.	NN
,	NN
who	NN
was	NN
advising	NN
on	NN
the	NN
deal	NN
,	NN
to	NN
confirm	NN
these	NN
rumors	NN
.	NN

Mr.	NN
Siegel	NN
asked	NN
Mr.	NN
Freeman	NN
who	NN
his	NN
source	NN
was	NN
and	NN
,	NN
on	NN
hearing	NN
that	NN
it	NN
was	NN
Bunny	NN
Lasker	NN
,	NN
responded	NN
:	NN
``	NN
Well	NN
,	NN
your	NN
bunny	NN
has	NN
a	NN
good	NN
nose	NN
.	NN
''	NN

The	NN
illegal	NN
``	NN
tip	NN
''	NN
of	NN
the	NN
bunny	NN
's	NN
good	NN
nose	NN
was	NN
then	NN
largely	NN
a	NN
confirmation	NN
of	NN
rumors	NN
already	NN
known	NN
to	NN
many	NN
in	NN
the	NN
market	NN
.	NN

Had	NN
the	NN
case	NN
gone	NN
to	NN
trial	NN
the	NN
same	NN
issues	NN
would	NN
have	NN
surfaced	NN
:	NN

Was	NN
there	NN
a	NN
fiduciary	NN
breach	NN
in	NN
order	NN
to	NN
obtain	NN
personal	NN
gain	NN
?	NN

Did	NN
Mr.	NN
Freeman	NN
have	NN
notice	NN
of	NN
this	NN
?	NN

Finally	NN
,	NN
was	NN
the	NN
information	NN
material	NN
?	NN

Yet	NN
,	NN
all	NN
these	NN
issues	NN
are	NN
subsidiary	NN
to	NN
a	NN
more	NN
central	NN
issue	NN
:	NN
Who	NN
is	NN
and	NN
who	NN
should	NN
be	NN
making	NN
the	NN
criminal	NN
law	NN
here	NN
?	NN

It	NN
is	NN
not	NN
my	NN
contention	NN
that	NN
either	NN
Mr.	NN
Chestman	NN
or	NN
Mr.	NN
Freeman	NN
was	NN
an	NN
innocent	NN
victim	NN
of	NN
prosecutorial	NN
overzealousness	NN
.	NN

Arguably	NN
,	NN
both	NN
were	NN
on	NN
notice	NN
that	NN
their	NN
behavior	NN
was	NN
at	NN
least	NN
risky	NN
.	NN

But	NN
even	NN
if	NN
they	NN
behaved	NN
recklessly	NN
,	NN
reasons	NN
still	NN
exist	NN
to	NN
fear	NN
and	NN
resist	NN
this	NN
steady	NN
process	NN
of	NN
case-by-case	NN
judicial	NN
extension	NN
of	NN
the	NN
law	NN
of	NN
insider	NN
trading	NN
.	NN

Courts	NN
and	NN
legislatures	NN
make	NN
decisions	NN
in	NN
very	NN
different	NN
ways	NN
and	NN
are	NN
each	NN
susceptible	NN
to	NN
very	NN
different	NN
kinds	NN
of	NN
errors	NN
.	NN

After-the-fact	NN
judicial	NN
examination	NN
of	NN
an	NN
actor	NN
's	NN
conduct	NN
has	NN
always	NN
been	NN
the	NN
common	NN
law	NN
's	NN
method	NN
.	NN

When	NN
only	NN
civil	NN
liability	NN
is	NN
involved	NN
,	NN
this	NN
method	NN
has	NN
the	NN
undeniable	NN
strengths	NN
of	NN
factual	NN
specificity	NN
and	NN
avoidance	NN
of	NN
overgeneralization	NN
.	NN

Still	NN
,	NN
case-by-case	NN
retrospective	NN
decision	NN
making	NN
of	NN
this	NN
sort	NN
is	NN
vulnerable	NN
to	NN
the	NN
tunnel	NN
vision	NN
caused	NN
by	NN
a	NN
fixation	NN
on	NN
ad	NN
hoc	NN
(	NN
and	NN
usually	NN
sleazy	NN
)	NN
examples	NN
.	NN

When	NN
a	NN
court	NN
decides	NN
that	NN
a	NN
particular	NN
actor	NN
's	NN
conduct	NN
was	NN
culpable	NN
and	NN
so	NN
extends	NN
the	NN
definition	NN
of	NN
insider	NN
trading	NN
to	NN
reach	NN
this	NN
conduct	NN
,	NN
it	NN
does	NN
not	NN
see	NN
the	NN
potentially	NN
enormous	NN
number	NN
of	NN
other	NN
cases	NN
that	NN
will	NN
be	NN
covered	NN
by	NN
the	NN
expanded	NN
rule	NN
.	NN

Thus	NN
,	NN
a	NN
court	NN
is	NN
poorly	NN
positioned	NN
to	NN
make	NN
judgments	NN
about	NN
the	NN
social	NN
utility	NN
of	NN
the	NN
expanded	NN
rule	NN
.	NN

For	NN
example	NN
,	NN
in	NN
focusing	NN
on	NN
Mr.	NN
Freeman	NN
's	NN
attempt	NN
to	NN
gain	NN
nonpublic	NN
information	NN
about	NN
a	NN
deal	NN
's	NN
collapse	NN
,	NN
one	NN
does	NN
not	NN
naturally	NN
think	NN
about	NN
the	NN
reverse	NN
side	NN
of	NN
the	NN
coin	NN
:	NN
What	NN
if	NN
the	NN
rumor	NN
had	NN
been	NN
false	NN
?	NN

Can	NN
a	NN
security	NN
analyst	NN
call	NN
an	NN
investment	NN
banker	NN
to	NN
make	NN
certain	NN
that	NN
a	NN
seemingly	NN
improbable	NN
rumor	NN
is	NN
in	NN
fact	NN
false	NN
?	NN

In	NN
the	NN
past	NN
,	NN
not	NN
only	NN
would	NN
reputable	NN
professionals	NN
have	NN
rushed	NN
to	NN
check	NN
out	NN
such	NN
rumors	NN
with	NN
the	NN
company	NN
,	NN
but	NN
companies	NN
listed	NN
on	NN
the	NN
major	NN
stock	NN
exchanges	NN
were	NN
encouraged	NN
by	NN
the	NN
exchanges	NN
to	NN
respond	NN
openly	NN
to	NN
such	NN
inquiries	NN
from	NN
securities	NN
analysts	NN
.	NN

Today	NN
,	NN
after	NN
Mr.	NN
Freeman	NN
's	NN
plea	NN
,	NN
there	NN
is	NN
an	NN
uncertainty	NN
that	NN
is	NN
both	NN
unfair	NN
and	NN
inefficient	NN
.	NN

In	NN
this	NN
light	NN
,	NN
the	NN
comparative	NN
advantages	NN
of	NN
legislative	NN
law-making	NN
become	NN
clear	NN
:	NN
(	NN
1	NN
)	NN
Before	NN
it	NN
acts	NN
,	NN
the	NN
legislature	NN
typically	NN
will	NN
hear	NN
the	NN
views	NN
of	NN
representatives	NN
of	NN
all	NN
those	NN
affected	NN
by	NN
its	NN
decision	NN

not	NN
just	NN
the	NN
immediate	NN
parties	NN
before	NN
the	NN
court	NN
;	NN
and	NN
(	NN

the	NN
legislature	NN
can	NN
frame	NN
``	NN
bright	NN

''	NN
standards	NN
that	NN
create	NN
less	NN
uncertainty	NN
than	NN
the	NN
fact-bound	NN
decisions	NN
of	NN
courts	NN
.	NN

Although	NN
legislative	NN
lines	NN
can	NN
result	NN
in	NN
under-inclusion	NN
(	NN

The	NN

the	NN

In	NN
1987	NN

the	NN

attempted	NN

Yet	NN

late	NN

Congress	NN
effectively	NN
reversed	NN
this	NN

enacting	NN
a	NN

The	NN

has	NN
never	NN

to	NN
woo	NN
advertisers	NN
with	NN
quite	NN
so	NN
much	NN
fervor	NN
before	NN

It	NN
largely	NN
rested	NN
on	NN

hard-to-fault	NN

The	NN
magazine	NN
had	NN
its	NN
best	NN
year	NN
yet	NN
in	NN
1988	NN
,	NN
when	NN
it	NN
celebrated	NN
its	NN
centennial	NN

racked	NN
up	NN
a	NN
17	NN

this	NN

when	NN
the	NN

surrounding	NN
its	NN
centennial	NN
died	NN

so	NN
too	NN
did	NN
some	NN
advertiser	NN
interest	NN
.	NN

The	NN
reason	NN
,	NN
ad	NN
executives	NN
say	NN
,	NN
is	NN
that	NN
the	NN
entire	NN
magazine	NN
business	NN
has	NN
been	NN
soft	NN

and	NN
National	NN

has	NN
some	NN
quirks	NN
that	NN
make	NN
it	NN
especially	NN
unattractive	NN
during	NN
a	NN
soft	NN
market	NN
.	NN

Perhaps	NN
the	NN
biggest	NN
of	NN
those	NN
factors	NN
is	NN
its	NN
high	NN

When	NN
ad	NN
dollars	NN
are	NN
tight	NN
,	NN
the	NN
high	NN
page	NN
cost	NN
is	NN
a	NN
major	NN
deterrent	NN
for	NN

To	NN
combat	NN
that	NN
problem	NN
,	NN
National	NN
Geographic	NN
,	NN
like	NN
other	NN
magazines	NN
,	NN
began	NN
offering	NN
regional	NN

But	NN
the	NN
magazine	NN
was	NN
slower	NN
than	NN
its	NN
competitors	NN
to	NN
come	NN
up	NN
with	NN
its	NN
regional	NN

until	NN

Another	NN

point	NN
for	NN

was	NN

Dual	NN

gives	NN
an	NN

the	NN
right	NN
to	NN
trade	NN
both	NN

The	NN
issue	NN
exploded	NN
this	NN

after	NN
a	NN
Federal	NN
Bureau	NN

operation	NN
led	NN
to	NN
charges	NN

abuses	NN
at	NN
the	NN
Chicago	NN

While	NN
not	NN

dual	NN

became	NN
a	NN
focus	NN
of	NN
attempts	NN
to	NN
tighten	NN

Critics	NN

Traders	NN
are	NN
likely	NN
to	NN
oppose	NN
such	NN
restrictions	NN
because	NN
dual	NN
trading	NN
provides	NN
a	NN
way	NN
to	NN
make	NN
money	NN
in	NN
slower	NN
markets	NN
where	NN
there	NN
is	NN
a	NN

The	NN
exchanges	NN
contend	NN
that	NN
dual	NN
trading	NN
improves	NN
liquidity	NN
in	NN
the	NN
markets	NN
because	NN
traders	NN
can	NN
buy	NN

sell	NN
even	NN
when	NN
they	NN
do	NN
n't	NN
have	NN
a	NN

The	NN

liquidity	NN

such	NN
as	NN
those	NN
with	NN
a	NN

The	NN

may	NN
take	NN
those	NN
arguments	NN

account	NN
by	NN

The	NN

the	NN

had	NN
this	NN
thing	NN
about	NN
the	NN

he	NN
wanted	NN

Now	NN
his	NN

let	NN
up	NN

it	NN

To	NN
keep	NN
him	NN

we	NN
invent	NN

run	NN

But	NN
we	NN
still	NN
hear	NN

Which	NN
brings	NN
up	NN
the	NN
worst	NN
and	NN
meanest	NN
ghost	NN
of	NN
all	NN
--	NN
the	NN
ghost	NN
of	NN
the	NN
shah	NN
of	NN
Iran	NN
.	NN

When	NN
the	NN
shah	NN
died	NN
,	NN
President	NN
Carter	NN
was	NN
so	NN
scared	NN
that	NN
the	NN
shah	NN
's	NN
ghost	NN
would	NN
blame	NN
him	NN
for	NN
shoving	NN
him	NN
out	NN
to	NN
make	NN
way	NN
for	NN
the	NN
ayatollah	NN
that	NN
he	NN
declared	NN
the	NN
Carter	NN
Doctrine	NN
.	NN

Mr.	NN
Carter	NN
said	NN
he	NN
would	NN
go	NN
to	NN
war	NN
to	NN
stop	NN
anyone	NN
from	NN
trying	NN
to	NN
grab	NN
Iran	NN
.	NN

But	NN
that	NN
ghost	NN
would	NN
n't	NN
settle	NN
for	NN
words	NN
,	NN
he	NN
wanted	NN
money	NN
and	NN
people	NN
--	NN
lots	NN
.	NN

So	NN
Mr.	NN
Carter	NN
formed	NN
three	NN
new	NN
Army	NN
divisions	NN
and	NN
gave	NN
them	NN
to	NN
a	NN
new	NN
bureaucracy	NN
in	NN
Tampa	NN
called	NN
the	NN
Rapid	NN
Deployment	NN
Force	NN
.	NN

But	NN
that	NN
ghost	NN
was	NN
n't	NN
fooled	NN
;	NN
he	NN
knew	NN
the	NN
RDF	NN
was	NN
neither	NN
rapid	NN
nor	NN
deployable	NN
nor	NN
a	NN
force	NN
--	NN
even	NN
though	NN
it	NN
cost	NN
$	NN
8	NN
billion	NN
or	NN
$	NN
10	NN
billion	NN
a	NN
year	NN
.	NN

After	NN
Mr.	NN
Carter	NN
was	NN
defeated	NN
in	NN
1980	NN
,	NN
the	NN
shah	NN
's	NN
ghost	NN
claimed	NN
the	NN
credit	NN
and	NN
then	NN
went	NN
after	NN
President	NN
Reagan	NN
and	NN
Cap	NN
Weinberger	NN
.	NN

I	NN
saw	NN
what	NN
he	NN
did	NN
to	NN
them	NN
firsthand	NN
.	NN

It	NN
made	NN
my	NN
shoelaces	NN
dance	NN
with	NN

Why	NN
,	NN
he	NN
used	NN
to	NN
lay	NN
in	NN
wait	NN
for	NN
Cap	NN
;	NN
suddenly	NN
he	NN
'd	NN
leap	NN
from	NN
behind	NN
some	NN
statue	NN
of	NN
Marshall	NN
onto	NN
Cap	NN
's	NN
chest	NN
and	NN
grab	NN
him	NN
by	NN
the	NN
throat	NN

choke	NN
him	NN
till	NN
he	NN
coughed	NN
up	NN
an	NN
additional	NN
$	NN
2	NN
billion	NN
or	NN
so	NN
.	NN

Cap	NN
added	NN
four	NN
more	NN

the	NN
Army	NN
,	NN
two	NN
active	NN

two	NN

,	NN
C-17	NN
and	NN
a	NN
thousand	NN
tactical	NN
aircraft	NN
to	NN
the	NN
Air	NN
Force	NN

He	NN
bought	NN
$	NN
4	NN

in	NN
prepositioning	NN
ships	NN
and	NN
$	NN
7	NN
billion	NN
in	NN
ammo	NN

them	NN

parked	NN

a	NN

at	NN
Diego	NN
Garcia	NN
in	NN
the	NN
middle	NN
of	NN
the	NN

He	NN
dedicated	NN
all	NN
these	NN
new	NN
forces	NN
to	NN
the	NN
Persian	NN

.	NN

One	NN
night	NN
both	NN
Marshall	NN
's	NN
ghost	NN
and	NN
the	NN
shah	NN
's	NN
ghost	NN
together	NN
caught	NN
Cap	NN
and	NN
threw	NN
him	NN
to	NN
the	NN
ground	NN
.	NN

Before	NN
they	NN
let	NN
him	NN
go	NN
he	NN
added	NN
a	NN
thousand	NN
bureaucrats	NN
to	NN
the	NN
RDF	NN
in	NN
Tampa	NN
and	NN
renamed	NN
it	NN
Central	NN
Command	NN
.	NN

He	NN
gave	NN
those	NN

charge	NN
of	NN
all	NN
naval	NN
operations	NN
in	NN
the	NN
Persian	NN
Gulf	NN
and	NN
Indian	NN

Marshall	NN
figured	NN
it	NN
would	NN
be	NN
good	NN
training	NN
for	NN
those	NN
soldiers	NN
--	NN
someday	NN
maybe	NN
they	NN
would	NN
get	NN
the	NN
whole	NN
Navy	NN
.	NN

They	NN
had	NN
fun	NN
moving	NN
the	NN
carriers	NN
around	NN
,	NN
but	NN
it	NN
turned	NN
out	NN
that	NN
they	NN
had	NN
forgotten	NN
all	NN
about	NN
mine	NN
sweepers	NN
.	NN

But	NN
the	NN
shah	NN
still	NN
kept	NN
leaping	NN
out	NN
at	NN
Cap	NN
,	NN
so	NN
Cap	NN
bought	NN
a	NN
hundred	NN
merchant	NN
ships	NN
more	NN
and	NN
$	NN
7	NN
billion	NN
of	NN
loading	NN
barges	NN

,	NN
in	NN
order	NN
that	NN
those	NN
seven	NN
new	NN
Army	NN
divisions	NN
and	NN
three	NN
Marine	NN
brigades	NN
could	NN
unload	NN
from	NN
all	NN
those	NN
new	NN
ships	NN
and	NN
aircraft	NN
and	NN
go	NN
to	NN
war	NN
in	NN
the	NN
Zagros	NN
mountains	NN
.	NN

Then	NN
suddenly	NN
Ike	NN
's	NN
ghost	NN
came	NN
to	NN
visit	NN
and	NN
said	NN
,	NN
``	NN

Lucky	NN

Ike	NN
was	NN

soon	NN
went	NN
away	NN

while	NN
the	NN

--	NN
he	NN
kept	NN
coming	NN
back	NN

So	NN
the	NN
U.S.	NN
found	NN
itself	NN
paying	NN
about	NN

We	NN
had	NN
great	NN

then	NN
it	NN
turned	NN
out	NN
that	NN

was	NN
not	NN
at	NN
all	NN
a	NN
nice	NN

the	NN

pointed	NN

silted	NN
up	NN

stay	NN

All	NN
