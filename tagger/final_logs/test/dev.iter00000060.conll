the	NN

were	IN
sketchy	DT
yesterday	NN

But	NN
most	IN

improper	IN

the	IN

the	DT
fact	NN
that	IN

in	IN
the	NN
case	IN
of	DT
the	NN
Nimitz	IN

,	IN
the	DT
lack	NN
of	IN
such	NN
support	IN

should	DT

that	IN

Tenneco	IN

pays	NN

reduce	IN

In	NN
this	IN

including	NN
some	IN

But	NN
some	IN
investors	NN
might	IN
prefer	DT
a	NN
simpler	IN
strategy	NN
then	IN
hedging	DT
their	NN
individual	IN

can	IN

this	IN
by	DT

that	IN

For	NN

,	NN
the	IN
most	DT
popular	NN
index	IN

is	IN
the	DT
S&P	NN
100	IN
option	NN
,	IN
commonly	DT
called	NN
the	IN
OEX	NN

It	NN
is	IN

stocks	NN
that	IN
make	NN
up	IN
Standard	DT

100-stock	IN
index	DT

Unlike	NN
options	IN
on	NN
individual	IN
issues	DT

index	IN
options	NN
are	IN
settled	DT
only	NN
in	IN
cash	NN
,	IN
and	DT
no	NN
stock	IN
is	NN
ever	IN
tendered	DT

But	NN
while	IN
index	NN
options	IN
are	DT
convenient	NN
,	IN
they	NN
have	IN
several	DT
disadvantages	NN

For	NN
one	IN
thing	NN
,	IN
an	DT
investor	NN
's	IN
portfolio	NN
might	IN
not	DT
closely	NN
match	IN
the	NN
S&P	IN
100	DT
.	NN

As	NN
a	IN
result	NN
,	IN
the	DT
OEX	NN
insurance	IN
may	NN
or	IN
may	DT
not	NN
fully	IN
protect	NN
an	IN
investor	DT

holdings	IN
in	NN
the	IN
event	DT
of	NN
a	IN
market	NN
decline	IN
.	DT

In	NN
addition	IN
,	NN
OEX	IN
options	DT
were	NN
suspended	IN

trading	IN
last	DT
Friday	NN
afternoon	IN
,	NN
after	IN

way	DT
and	NN
trading	IN
in	NN
the	IN
S&P-500	DT

wanted	DT
to	NN
realize	IN
a	NN
profit	IN
on	DT
OEX	NN
puts	IN
after	NN

would	IN

only	NN

Ultimately	NN
,	IN
whether	NN
the	IN
insurance	DT
provided	NN
by	IN
purchasing	NN
puts	IN
is	DT
worthwhile	NN
depends	IN
on	NN
the	IN
cost	DT
of	NN
the	IN
options	NN
.	IN

That	NN
cost	IN
rises	NN
in	IN
times	DT
of	NN

But	NN
it	IN
still	NN
might	IN
be	DT
cheaper	NN
than	IN
taking	NN
a	IN

hit	NN
.	IN

The	NN
protection	IN
from	NN
using	IN

is	IN
clearly	NN
superior	IN
to	DT
that	NN
afforded	IN
by	NN

In	NN

Mr.	NN

``	IN

Mr.	IN

Mr.	NN

on	IN

``	IN

The	NN
illegal	IN
``	NN

of	NN
the	IN

was	IN
then	NN
largely	IN
a	DT
confirmation	NN
of	IN
rumors	NN
already	IN
known	DT

many	IN

the	IN

Had	NN
the	IN
case	NN
gone	IN

the	IN

Was	NN
there	IN
a	NN
fiduciary	IN

Did	NN
Mr.	IN

Finally	NN

the	IN

Yet	NN
,	IN
all	NN
these	IN

Who	IN

who	IN
should	NN
be	IN
making	DT
the	NN
criminal	IN
law	NN
here	IN

It	NN
is	IN
not	NN
my	IN
contention	DT
that	NN
either	IN
Mr.	NN

Mr.	NN
Freeman	IN
was	NN
an	IN

victim	NN

Arguably	NN

both	NN
were	IN

at	NN

process	IN

After-the-fact	NN
judicial	IN
examination	NN
of	IN
an	DT

When	NN

the	NN

Still	NN

case-by-case	NN

decision	DT

When	NN
a	IN
court	NN
decides	IN
that	DT
a	NN

was	NN
culpable	IN

extends	DT
the	NN

this	NN
