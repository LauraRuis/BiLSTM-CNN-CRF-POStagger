halt	NN

whenever	IN

arose	IN

The	IN
New	NN

Stock	IN

adopted	NN
two	IN
specific	NN
circuit	NN
breakers	IN
:	NN
If	NN
the	IN
Dow	NN
Jones	NN
index	IN
falls	NN
250	NN
points	IN
in	NN
a	NN
day	IN
,	NN
the	NN

the	IN
exchange	NN
will	NN
close	IN

an	NN
additional	IN
two	NN
hours	NN

The	IN
rationale	NN
is	NN
that	IN
an	NN
interruption	NN
of	IN

will	NN
allow	IN
investors	NN
to	NN
reconsider	IN
their	NN
strategies	NN

calm	NN

lead	NN
buyers	NN
to	IN
enter	NN
the	NN

It	IN
is	NN
impossible	NN

whether	NN
that	IN
theory	NN

A	IN
temporary	NN

feeding	IN

also	IN
the	NN

also	NN

of	NN
the	IN

seems	NN
to	IN
have	NN

that	IN

according	IN
to	NN
Mr.	NN

Most	IN
analysts	NN

had	NN
expected	IN
a	NN

on	IN

proposed	NN
transaction	IN
,	NN
which	NN
was	IN
announced	NN
in	NN
July	IN

long	NN
before	IN

Many	IN
interpret	NN
the	NN
delay	IN
as	NN
an	NN
indication	IN
that	NN
regulators	NN
are	IN
skeptical	NN
about	NN
the	IN
proposal	NN

CenTrust	IN

however	NN

the	NN

It	IN
said	NN
the	NN

would	NN
give	NN
it	IN
positive	NN

82	IN

bringing	NN

Critics	IN

however	NN

say	NN
the	NN
branch	IN
sale	NN
will	NN
make	IN
CenTrust	NN
more	NN
dependent	IN
than	NN
ever	NN
on	IN

Mr.	IN
Paul	NN
counters	NN
that	IN
he	NN
intends	NN
to	IN
further	NN
pare	NN
the	IN
size	NN
of	NN
CenTrust	IN
by	NN
not	NN

The	IN

working	NN

quoted	IN

Mr.	IN

said	NN
that	IN
many	NN
Jewish	NN

feel	NN
guilty	NN
toward	IN

,	NN
so	IN

support	NN

He	IN
said	NN
that	NN
many	IN

feel	IN
bitter	NN
about	NN

so	IN
they	NN
,	NN
too	IN
,	NN
support	NN
black	IN

He	IN
said	NN
that	NN

have	NN
contributed	NN
more	IN
to	NN
black	NN
causes	IN
over	NN
the	NN
years	IN
than	NN
vice	NN

.	NN

Of	IN
course	NN
,	NN
Mr.	IN
Mason	NN
did	NN
not	IN
use	NN
neutral	NN
language	IN
.	NN

As	IN
a	NN
practitioner	NN
of	IN
ethnic	NN
humor	NN
from	IN
the	NN
old	NN
days	IN
on	NN
the	NN
Borscht	IN
Belt	NN
,	NN
live	IN
television	NN
and	NN
the	IN
nightclub	NN
circuit	NN
,	IN
Mr.	NN
Mason	NN
instinctively	IN
reached	NN
for	NN
the	IN
vernacular	NN
.	NN

He	IN
said	NN
Jews	NN
were	IN
``	NN
sick	NN
with	IN
complexes	NN
''	NN
;	IN
and	NN
he	NN
called	IN
David	NN
Dinkins	NN
,	IN
Mr.	NN

black	NN
opponent	NN
,	IN
``	NN
a	NN
fancy	IN
shvartze	NN
with	NN
a	IN
mustache	NN
.	NN
''	IN

If	IN
Mr.	NN
Mason	NN
had	IN
used	NN
less	NN
derogatory	IN
language	NN
to	NN
articulate	IN
his	NN
amateur	NN
analysis	IN
of	NN
the	NN
voting	IN
behavior	NN
of	NN
his	IN
fellow	NN
New	NN
Yorkers	IN
,	NN
would	NN
the	IN
water	NN
be	NN
quite	IN
so	NN
hot	NN
?	IN

It	IN
probably	NN
would	NN
,	IN
because	NN
few	NN
or	IN
none	NN
of	NN
the	IN
people	NN
upset	NN
by	IN
Mr.	NN
Mason	NN
's	IN
remarks	NN
have	NN
bothered	IN
to	NN
distinguish	NN
between	IN
the	NN
substance	NN
of	IN
his	NN
comments	NN
and	IN
the	NN
fact	NN
that	IN
he	NN
used	NN
insulting	IN
language	NN
.	NN

In	IN
addition	NN
,	NN
some	IN
of	NN
Mr.	NN
Mason	IN
's	NN
critics	NN
have	IN
implied	NN
that	NN
his	IN
type	NN
of	NN
ethnic	IN
humor	NN
is	NN
itself	IN
a	NN
form	NN
of	IN
racism	NN
.	NN

For	IN
example	NN
,	NN
the	IN
New	NN
York	NN
state	IN
counsel	NN
for	NN
the	IN
NAACP	NN
said	NN
that	IN
Mr.	NN
Mason	NN
is	IN
``	NN
like	NN
a	IN
dinosaur	NN
.	NN

People	IN
are	NN
fast	NN
leaving	IN
the	NN
place	NN
where	IN
he	NN
is	NN
stuck	IN
.	NN
''	NN

These	IN
critics	NN
fail	NN
to	IN
distinguish	NN
between	NN
the	IN
type	NN
of	NN
ethnic	IN
humor	NN
that	NN
aims	IN
at	NN
disparaging	NN
another	IN
group	NN
,	NN
such	IN
as	NN
``	NN
Polish	IN
jokes	NN
''	NN
;	IN
and	NN
the	NN
type	IN
that	NN
is	NN
double-edged	IN
,	NN
aiming	NN
inward	IN
as	NN
well	NN
as	IN
outward	NN
.	NN

The	IN
latter	NN
typically	NN
is	IN
the	NN
humor	NN
of	IN
the	NN
underdog	NN
,	IN
and	NN
it	NN
was	IN
perfected	NN
by	NN
both	IN
blacks	NN
and	NN
Jews	IN
on	NN
the	NN
minstrel	IN
and	NN
vaudeville	NN
stage	IN
as	NN
a	NN
means	IN
of	NN
mocking	NN
their	IN
white	NN
and	NN
gentile	IN
audiences	NN
along	NN
with	IN
themselves	NN
.	NN

In	IN
the	NN
hands	NN
of	IN
a	NN
zealot	NN
like	IN
Lenny	NN
Bruce	NN
,	IN
this	NN
double-edged	NN
blade	IN
could	NN
cut	NN
both	IN
the	NN
self	NN
and	IN
the	NN
audience	NN
to	IN
ribbons	NN
.	NN

But	IN
wielded	NN
by	NN
a	IN
pro	NN
like	NN
Jackie	IN
Mason	NN
,	NN
it	IN
is	NN
a	NN
constructive	IN
form	NN
of	NN
mischief	IN
.	NN

Why	IN
constructive	NN
?	NN

Because	IN
despite	NN
all	NN
the	IN
media	NN
prattle	NN
about	IN
comedy	NN
and	NN
politics	IN
not	NN
mixing	NN
,	IN
they	NN
are	NN
similar	IN
in	NN
one	NN
respect	IN
:	NN
Both	NN
can	IN
serve	NN
as	NN
mechanisms	IN
for	NN
easing	NN
tensions	IN
and	NN
facilitating	NN
the	IN
co-existence	NN
of	NN
groups	IN
in	NN
conflict	NN
.	IN

That	IN
's	NN
why	NN
it	IN
's	NN
dangerous	NN
to	IN
have	NN
well-intentioned	NN
thought	IN
police	NN
,	NN
on	IN
college	NN
campuses	NN
and	IN
elsewhere	NN
,	NN
taboo	IN
all	NN
critical	NN
mention	IN
of	NN
group	NN
differences	IN
.	NN

As	IN
Elizabeth	NN
Kristol	NN
wrote	IN
in	NN
the	NN
New	IN

Times	NN
just	IN
before	NN
the	NN
Mason	IN

``	IN
Perhaps	NN

over	IN

such	NN
intensity	IN
if	NN

allowed	NN
to	IN
simmer	NN
.	NN
''	IN

The	IN
question	NN
is	NN
,	IN
if	NN
group	NN
conflicts	IN
still	NN
exist	NN
(	IN
as	NN
undeniably	NN
they	IN
do	NN
)	NN
,	IN
and	NN
if	NN
Mr.	IN
Mason	NN
's	NN
type	IN
of	NN
ethnic	NN
humor	IN
is	NN
passe	NN
,	IN
then	NN
what	NN
other	IN
means	NN
do	NN
we	IN
have	NN
for	NN
letting	IN
off	NN
steam	NN
?	IN

Do	IN
n't	NN
say	NN
the	IN
TV	NN
sitcom	NN
,	IN
because	NN
that	NN
happens	IN
to	NN
be	NN
a	IN
genre	NN
that	NN
,	IN
in	NN
its	NN
desperate	IN
need	NN
to	NN
attract	IN
everybody	NN
and	NN
offend	IN
nobody	NN
,	NN
resembles	IN
politics	NN
more	NN
than	IN
it	NN
does	NN
comedy	IN
.	NN

It	IN
is	NN
true	NN
that	IN
the	NN
best	NN
sitcoms	IN
do	NN
allow	NN
group	IN
differences	NN
to	NN
simmer	IN
:	NN
yuppies	NN
vs.	IN
blue-collar	NN
Bostonians	NN
in	IN
``	NN

''	IN
;	NN
children	NN
vs.	IN
adults	NN
in	NN
``	IN
The	NN
Cosby	NN
Show	IN
.	NN
''	NN

But	IN
these	NN
are	NN
not	IN
the	NN
differences	NN
that	IN
make	NN
headlines	NN
.	IN

In	IN
``	NN
Chicken	NN

Mr.	IN
Mason	NN
plays	NN
Jackie	IN

It	IN

worth	NN

they	IN

It	IN

that	IN
``	NN

is	NN
being	IN

And	IN
a	NN
safe	NN
one	IN
--	NN
imagine	NN
if	IN
the	NN

were	NN
between	IN
an	NN
Orthodox	NN
Jew	IN
and	NN
a	NN
member	IN
of	NN
the	NN
Nation	IN
of	NN
Islam	NN
.	IN

Back	IN
in	NN
the	NN
1920s	IN
,	NN
the	NN
play	IN
and	NN
movie	NN
versions	IN
of	NN
``	NN
Abie	IN

made	NN
the	IN
theme	NN
of	NN
courtship	IN
between	NN
the	NN
assimilated	IN
offspring	NN
of	NN
Jewish	IN

Irish	NN

so	NN
popular	NN
that	IN
its	NN
author	NN

lost	NN
a	NN

suit	NN
on	NN
the	IN
grounds	NN
that	NN
the	IN
plot	NN
has	NN
entered	IN
the	NN
public	NN
domain	IN
.	NN

And	IN
it	NN
has	NN
remained	IN
there	NN
,	NN
as	IN
evidenced	NN
by	NN
its	IN
reappearance	NN
in	NN
a	IN
1972	NN
CBS	NN
sitcom	IN
called	NN
``	NN
Bridget	IN
Loves	NN
Bernie	NN
,	IN
''	NN
whose	NN
sole	IN
distinction	NN
was	NN
that	IN
it	NN
led	NN
to	IN
the	NN
real-life	NN
marriage	IN
of	NN
Meredith	NN
Baxter	IN
and	NN
David	NN
Birney	IN
.	NN

Clearly	IN
,	NN
the	NN
question	IN
with	NN
``	NN
Chicken	IN
Soup	NN
''	NN
is	IN
not	NN
whether	NN
the	IN
pot	NN
will	NN
boil	IN
over	NN
,	NN
but	IN
whether	NN
it	NN
will	IN
simmer	NN
at	NN
all	IN
.	NN

So	IN
far	NN
,	NN
the	IN
bubbles	NN
have	NN
been	IN
few	NN
and	NN
far	IN
between	NN
.	NN

Part	IN
of	NN
the	NN
problem	IN
is	NN
the	NN
tendency	IN
of	NN
all	NN
sitcoms	IN
,	NN
ever	NN
since	IN
the	NN
didactic	NN
days	IN
of	NN
Norman	NN
Lear	IN
,	NN
to	NN
preach	IN
about	NN
social	NN
issues	IN
.	NN

To	IN
some	NN
extent	NN
,	IN
this	NN
tendency	NN
emerges	IN
whenever	NN
the	NN
show	IN
tries	NN
to	NN
enlighten	IN
us	NN
about	NN
ethnic	IN
stereotypes	NN
by	NN
reversing	IN
them	NN
.	NN

For	IN
instance	NN
,	NN
Michael	IN
dislikes	NN
Jackie	NN
not	IN
because	NN
he	NN
's	IN
a	NN
shrewd	NN
Jewish	IN
businessman	NN
,	NN
but	IN
because	NN
he	NN
quits	IN
his	NN
well-paying	NN
job	IN
as	NN
a	NN
salesman	IN
in	NN
order	NN
to	IN
become	NN
a	NN
social	IN
worker	NN
.	NN

Even	IN
more	NN
problematic	NN
is	IN
the	NN
incompatibility	NN
between	IN
sitcom	NN
preachiness	NN
and	IN
Mr.	NN
Mason	NN
's	IN
comic	NN
persona	NN
.	IN

The	IN
best	NN
moments	NN
in	IN
the	NN
show	NN
occur	IN
at	NN
the	NN
beginning	IN
and	NN
the	NN
end	IN
(	NN
and	NN
occasionally	IN
in	NN
the	NN
middle	IN
)	NN
,	NN
when	IN
Mr.	NN
Mason	NN
slips	IN
into	NN
his	NN
standup	IN
mode	NN
and	NN
starts	IN
meting	NN
out	NN
that	IN
old-fashioned	NN
Jewish	NN
mischief	IN
to	NN
other	NN
people	IN
as	NN
well	NN
as	IN
to	NN
himself	NN
.	IN

But	IN
too	NN
often	NN
,	IN
these	NN
routines	NN
lack	IN
spark	NN
because	NN
this	IN
sitcom	NN
,	NN
like	IN
all	NN
sitcoms	NN
,	IN
is	NN
timid	NN
about	IN
confronting	NN
Mr.	NN
Mason	IN
's	NN
stock	NN
in	IN
trade	NN
-	NN
ethnic	IN
differences	NN
.	NN

I	IN
'm	NN
not	NN
suggesting	IN
that	NN
the	NN
producers	IN
start	NN
putting	NN
together	IN
episodes	NN
about	NN
topics	IN
like	NN
the	NN
Catholic-Jewish	IN
dispute	NN
over	NN
the	IN
Carmelite	NN
convent	NN
at	IN
Auschwitz	NN
.	NN

That	IN
issue	NN
,	NN
like	IN
racial	NN
tensions	NN
in	IN
New	NN

will	NN
have	IN
to	NN
cool	NN
down	IN
,	NN
not	NN
heat	IN
up	NN
,	NN
before	IN
it	NN
can	NN
simmer	IN

But	IN
I	NN
am	NN
suggesting	IN
that	NN
they	NN
stop	IN
requiring	NN
Mr.	NN
Mason	IN
to	NN
interrupt	NN
his	IN
classic	NN
shtik	NN
with	IN
some	NN
line	NN
about	IN
``	NN

The	IN

I	IN
disagree	NN
with	NN
the	IN
statement	NN
by	NN
Mr.	IN

that	NN
one	IN
should	NN
not	NN
draw	IN
an	NN
adverse	NN

their	NN
Fifth	NN
Amendment	IN
privilege	NN

The	IN
Fifth	NN

states	IN

that	NN
no	NN
person	IN
``	NN

This	IN
privilege	NN

self-incrimination	IN
precludes	NN
the	NN
drawing	IN
of	NN
an	NN
adverse	IN

against	NN
a	IN
criminal	NN

chooses	NN

Thus	IN

in	NN
a	IN

a	NN

can	IN
not	NN
comment	NN
on	IN
a	NN

the	IN

``	NN

The	IN

that	NN

the	NN

it	NN
attempted	IN

invade	NN
two	IN

the	NN

cost	IN

rationale	IN

``	IN

Two	IN

heavily	NN
implicated	IN
in	NN
the	NN
Koskotas	IN

to	NN
refer	IN
them	NN
to	NN
the	IN
special	NN

But	IN
eluding	NN

probe	IN
was	NN
the	NN
case	IN

millions	NN

Mr.	NN
Koskotas	IN
funneled	NN
into	NN
New	IN

In	IN

the	NN

On	IN

Despite	IN
convincing	NN
arguments	NN
,	IN
it	NN
was	NN
never	IN
established	NN
that	NN
Mr.	IN
Papandreou	NN
personally	NN
ordered	IN

the	IN

The	IN
central	NN
weakness	NN
of	IN

was	IN
pointed	NN
up	NN
especially	IN
well	NN
when	NN
discussions	IN
focused	NN
on	NN
arms	IN
deals	NN

kickbacks	IN

The	IN
coalition	NN
government	NN
tried	IN
to	NN
show	NN
that	IN
PASOK	NN

had	IN
received	NN
hefty	NN
sums	IN

Naturally	IN

neither	NN

could	NN
be	NN

to	NN
various	IN

So	IN
it	NN
seems	NN
that	IN
Mr.	NN
Mitsotakis	NN
and	IN
his	NN
communist	NN
chums	IN
may	NN
have	NN
unwittingly	IN
served	NN
Mr.	NN

whether	NN

while	NN
verbal	NN

alone	NN
wo	IN
n't	NN
help	NN
PASOK	IN
regain	NN
power	NN
,	IN
Mr.	NN
Papandreou	NN
should	IN
never	NN
be	NN
underestimated	IN
.	NN

First	IN
came	NN
his	NN
predictable	IN
fusillade	NN
:	NN
He	IN
charged	NN
the	NN
Coalition	IN
of	NN
the	NN
Left	IN
and	NN
Progress	NN
had	IN
sold	NN
out	NN
its	IN
leftist	NN
tenets	NN
by	IN
collaborating	NN
in	NN
a	IN
right-wing	NN
plot	NN
aimed	IN
at	NN
ousting	NN
PASOK	IN
and	NN
thwarting	NN
the	IN
course	NN
of	NN
socialism	IN
in	NN
Greece	NN
.	IN

Then	IN
,	NN
to	NN
buttress	IN
his	NN
credibility	NN
with	IN
the	NN
left	NN
,	IN
he	NN
enticed	NN
some	IN
smaller	NN
leftist	NN
parties	IN
to	NN
stand	NN
for	IN
election	NN
under	NN
the	IN
PASOK	NN
banner	NN
.	IN

Next	IN
,	NN
he	NN
continued	IN
to	NN
court	NN
the	IN
communists	NN
--	NN
many	IN
of	NN
whom	NN
feel	IN
betrayed	NN
by	NN
the	IN
left-right	NN
coalition	NN
's	IN
birth	NN
--	NN
by	IN
bringing	NN
into	NN
PASOK	IN
a	NN
well-respected	NN
Communist	IN
Party	NN
candidate	NN
.	IN

For	IN
balance	NN
,	NN
and	IN
in	NN
hopes	NN
of	IN
gaining	NN
some	NN
disaffected	IN
centrist	NN
votes	NN
,	IN
he	NN
managed	NN
to	IN
attract	NN
a	NN
former	IN
New	NN
Democracy	NN
Party	IN
representative	NN
and	NN
known	IN
political	NN
enemy	NN
of	IN
Mr.	NN
Mitsotakis	NN
.	IN

Thus	IN
PASOK	NN
heads	NN
for	IN
the	NN
polls	NN
not	IN
only	NN
with	NN
diminished	IN
scandal-stench	NN
,	NN
but	IN
also	NN
with	NN
``	IN

the	IN
matter	NN
awaits	NN
final	IN
approval	NN
from	NN

The	IN

seem	NN

the	IN
importance	NN
of	NN
the	IN
case	NN
as	NN
a	IN

That	IN

As	IN

the	IN
South	NN
African	NN
government	IN
will	NN
be	NN
ever	IN
more	NN
hard	NN
pressed	IN
to	NN
justify	NN
the	IN
continued	NN
imprisonment	NN
of	IN
Mr.	NN

the	IN

the	IN

The	IN

The	IN

watching	IN

Pretoria	NN

Pretoria	IN

In	IN

the	IN
government	NN
is	NN
figuring	IN
that	NN

create	NN
a	IN
