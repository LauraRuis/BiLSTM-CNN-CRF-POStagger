After	IN

that	NN
it	IN
would	NN
be	IN

to	IN
halt	NN

whenever	NN

arose	IN

The	IN
New	NN

Stock	NN

adopted	NN
two	IN
specific	NN
circuit	IN
breakers	NN
:	IN
If	NN
the	IN
Dow	NN
Jones	IN
index	NN
falls	IN
250	NN
points	IN
in	NN
a	IN
day	NN
,	IN
the	NN

points	NN

the	NN
exchange	IN
will	NN
close	IN

an	IN
additional	NN
two	IN
hours	NN
.	IN

The	IN
rationale	NN
is	IN
that	NN
an	IN
interruption	NN
of	IN

will	IN
allow	NN
investors	IN
to	NN
reconsider	IN
their	NN
strategies	IN

calm	IN

lead	NN
buyers	IN
to	NN
enter	IN
the	NN

at	NN
indicated	IN

levels	NN

It	IN
is	NN
impossible	IN

know	IN
whether	NN
that	IN
theory	NN

.	IN

A	IN
temporary	NN
cessation	IN

indeed	IN
discourage	NN
a	IN

panic	IN
from	NN
feeding	IN

itself	IN

there	NN
is	IN
also	NN
the	IN
possibility	NN
that	IN

fears	IN

according	IN

Mr.	IN

Most	IN

had	NN

,	NN
which	IN
was	NN
announced	IN
in	NN

long	IN

Many	IN
interpret	NN
the	IN

about	NN
the	IN

Critics	IN

say	IN
the	NN
branch	IN

will	IN
make	NN
CenTrust	IN
more	NN
dependent	IN

ever	IN
on	NN

Mr.	IN
Paul	NN
counters	IN
that	NN
he	IN
intends	NN
to	IN
further	NN
pare	IN
the	NN
size	IN

CenTrust	IN

not	IN

The	IN

remarks	NN

quoted	NN
first	IN
in	NN

in	IN

Mr.	IN
Mason	NN
said	IN
that	NN
many	IN
Jewish	NN
voters	IN
feel	NN
guilty	IN
toward	NN
blacks	IN
,	NN
so	IN
they	NN
support	IN
black	NN

uncritically	NN

He	IN
said	NN
that	IN
many	NN
black	IN
voters	NN
feel	IN
bitter	NN
about	IN
racial	NN

,	NN
so	IN
they	NN
,	IN
too	NN
,	IN
support	NN
black	IN
candidates	NN
uncritically	IN

He	IN
said	NN
that	IN
Jews	NN
have	IN
contributed	NN
more	IN
to	NN
black	IN
causes	NN
over	IN
the	NN
years	IN
than	NN
vice	IN

.	IN

Of	IN
course	NN
,	IN
Mr.	NN
Mason	IN
did	NN
not	IN
use	NN
neutral	IN
language	NN
.	IN

As	IN
a	NN
practitioner	IN
of	NN
ethnic	IN
humor	NN
from	IN
the	NN
old	IN
days	NN
on	IN
the	NN
Borscht	IN
Belt	NN
,	IN
live	NN
television	IN
and	NN
the	IN
nightclub	NN
circuit	IN
,	NN
Mr.	IN
Mason	NN
instinctively	IN
reached	NN
for	IN
the	NN
vernacular	IN
.	NN

He	IN
said	NN
Jews	IN
were	NN
``	IN
sick	NN
with	IN
complexes	NN
''	IN
;	NN
and	IN
he	NN
called	IN
David	NN
Dinkins	IN
,	NN
Mr.	IN
Giuliani	NN
's	IN
black	NN
opponent	IN
,	NN
``	IN
a	NN
fancy	IN
shvartze	NN
with	IN
a	NN
mustache	IN
.	NN
''	IN

If	IN
Mr.	NN
Mason	IN
had	NN
used	IN
less	NN
derogatory	IN
language	NN
to	IN
articulate	NN
his	IN
amateur	NN
analysis	IN
of	NN
the	IN
voting	NN
behavior	IN
of	NN
his	IN
fellow	NN
New	IN
Yorkers	NN
,	IN
would	NN
the	IN
water	NN
be	IN
quite	NN
so	IN
hot	NN
?	IN

It	IN
probably	NN
would	IN
,	NN
because	IN
few	NN
or	IN
none	NN
of	IN
the	NN
people	IN
upset	NN
by	IN
Mr.	NN
Mason	IN
's	NN
remarks	IN
have	NN
bothered	IN
to	NN
distinguish	IN
between	NN
the	IN
substance	NN
of	IN
his	NN
comments	IN
and	NN
the	IN
fact	NN
that	IN
he	NN
used	IN
insulting	NN
language	IN
.	NN

In	IN
addition	NN
,	IN
some	NN
of	IN
Mr.	NN
Mason	IN
's	NN
critics	IN
have	NN
implied	IN
that	NN
his	IN
type	NN
of	IN
ethnic	NN
humor	IN
is	NN
itself	IN
a	NN
form	IN
of	NN
racism	IN
.	NN

For	IN
example	NN
,	IN
the	NN
New	IN
York	NN
state	IN
counsel	NN
for	IN
the	NN
NAACP	IN
said	NN
that	IN
Mr.	NN
Mason	IN
is	NN
``	IN
like	NN
a	IN
dinosaur	NN
.	IN

People	IN
are	NN
fast	IN
leaving	NN
the	IN
place	NN
where	IN
he	NN
is	IN
stuck	NN
.	IN
''	NN

These	IN
critics	NN
fail	IN
to	NN
distinguish	IN
between	NN
the	IN
type	NN
of	IN
ethnic	NN
humor	IN
that	NN
aims	IN
at	NN
disparaging	IN
another	NN
group	IN
,	NN
such	IN
as	NN
``	IN
Polish	NN
jokes	IN
''	NN
;	IN
and	NN
the	IN
type	NN
that	IN
is	NN
double-edged	IN
,	NN
aiming	IN
inward	NN
as	IN
well	NN
as	IN
outward	NN
.	IN

The	IN
latter	NN
typically	IN
is	NN
the	IN
humor	NN
of	IN
the	NN
underdog	IN
,	NN
and	IN
it	NN
was	IN
perfected	NN
by	IN
both	NN
blacks	IN
and	NN
Jews	IN
on	NN
the	IN
minstrel	NN
and	IN
vaudeville	NN
stage	IN
as	NN
a	IN
means	NN
of	IN
mocking	NN
their	IN
white	NN
and	IN
gentile	NN
audiences	IN
along	NN
with	IN
themselves	NN
.	IN

In	IN
the	NN
hands	IN
of	NN
a	IN
zealot	NN
like	IN
Lenny	NN
Bruce	IN
,	NN
this	IN
double-edged	NN
blade	IN
could	NN
cut	IN
both	NN
the	IN
self	NN
and	IN
the	NN
audience	IN
to	NN
ribbons	IN
.	NN

But	IN
wielded	NN
by	IN
a	NN
pro	IN
like	NN
Jackie	IN
Mason	NN
,	IN
it	NN
is	IN
a	NN
constructive	IN
form	NN
of	IN
mischief	NN
.	IN

Why	IN
constructive	NN
?	IN

Because	IN
despite	NN
all	IN
the	NN
media	IN
prattle	NN
about	IN
comedy	NN
and	IN
politics	NN
not	IN
mixing	NN
,	IN
they	NN
are	IN
similar	NN
in	IN
one	NN
respect	IN
:	NN
Both	IN
can	NN
serve	IN
as	NN
mechanisms	IN
for	NN
easing	IN
tensions	NN
and	IN
facilitating	NN
the	IN
co-existence	NN
of	IN
groups	NN
in	IN
conflict	NN
.	IN

That	IN
's	NN
why	IN
it	NN
's	IN
dangerous	NN
to	IN
have	NN
well-intentioned	IN
thought	NN
police	IN
,	NN
on	IN
college	NN
campuses	IN
and	NN
elsewhere	IN
,	NN
taboo	IN
all	NN
critical	IN
mention	NN
of	IN
group	NN
differences	IN
.	NN

As	IN
Elizabeth	NN
Kristol	IN
wrote	NN
in	IN
the	NN
New	IN
York	NN
Times	IN
just	NN
before	IN
the	NN
Mason	IN

``	NN
Perhaps	IN

not	NN
boil	IN
over	NN
with	IN
such	NN
intensity	IN
if	NN

allowed	NN
to	IN
simmer	NN
.	IN
''	NN

The	IN
question	NN
is	IN
,	NN
if	IN
group	NN
conflicts	IN
still	NN
exist	IN
(	NN
as	IN
undeniably	NN
they	IN
do	NN
)	IN
,	NN
and	IN
if	NN
Mr.	IN
Mason	NN
's	IN
type	NN
of	IN
ethnic	NN
humor	IN
is	NN
passe	IN
,	NN
then	IN
what	NN
other	IN
means	NN
do	IN
we	NN
have	IN
for	NN
letting	IN
off	NN
steam	IN
?	NN

Do	IN
n't	NN
say	IN
the	NN
TV	IN
sitcom	NN
,	IN
because	NN
that	IN
happens	NN
to	IN
be	NN
a	IN
genre	NN
that	IN
,	NN
in	IN
its	NN
desperate	IN
need	NN
to	IN
attract	NN
everybody	IN
and	NN
offend	IN
nobody	NN
,	IN
resembles	NN
politics	IN
more	NN
than	IN
it	NN
does	IN
comedy	NN
.	IN

It	IN
is	NN
true	IN
that	NN
the	IN
best	NN
sitcoms	IN
do	NN
allow	IN
group	NN
differences	IN
to	NN
simmer	IN
:	NN
yuppies	IN
vs.	NN
blue-collar	IN
Bostonians	NN
in	IN
``	NN
Cheers	IN
''	NN
;	IN
children	NN
vs.	IN
adults	NN
in	IN
``	NN
The	IN
Cosby	NN
Show	IN
.	NN
''	IN

But	IN
these	NN
are	IN
not	NN
the	IN
differences	NN
that	IN
make	NN
headlines	IN
.	NN

In	IN
``	NN
Chicken	IN

Mr.	IN
Mason	NN
plays	IN
Jackie	NN

her	IN

It	IN
's	NN
worth	IN
noting	NN
that	IN

At	IN

they	NN
both	IN

strong	NN

as	IN
do	NN
Jackie	IN

It	IN
could	NN
n't	IN
be	NN
more	IN
obvious	NN
that	IN
``	NN

is	NN
being	IN
made	NN
from	IN
an	NN

.	IN

And	IN
a	NN
safe	IN
one	NN
--	IN
imagine	NN
if	IN
the	NN
romance	IN
in	NN
question	IN
were	NN
between	IN
an	NN
Orthodox	IN
Jew	NN
and	IN
a	NN
member	IN
of	NN
the	IN
Nation	NN
of	IN
Islam	NN
.	IN

Back	IN
in	NN
the	IN
1920s	NN
,	IN
the	NN
play	IN
and	NN
movie	IN
versions	NN
of	IN
``	NN
Abie	IN
's	NN

''	IN
made	NN
the	IN
theme	NN
of	IN
courtship	NN
between	IN
the	NN
assimilated	IN
offspring	NN
of	IN
Jewish	NN
and	IN
Irish	NN
immigrants	IN
so	NN
popular	IN
that	NN
its	IN
author	NN
,	IN
Anne	NN
Nichols	IN
,	NN
lost	IN
a	NN
plagiarism	IN
suit	NN
on	IN
the	NN
grounds	IN
that	NN
the	IN
plot	NN
has	IN
entered	NN
the	IN
public	NN
domain	IN
.	NN

And	IN
it	NN
has	IN
remained	NN
there	IN
,	NN
as	IN
evidenced	NN
by	IN
its	NN
reappearance	IN
in	NN
a	IN
1972	NN
CBS	IN
sitcom	NN
called	IN
``	NN
Bridget	IN
Loves	NN
Bernie	IN
,	NN
''	IN
whose	NN
sole	IN
distinction	NN
was	IN
that	NN
it	IN
led	NN
to	IN
the	NN
real-life	IN
marriage	NN
of	IN
Meredith	NN
Baxter	IN
and	NN
David	IN
Birney	NN
.	IN

Clearly	IN
,	NN
the	IN
question	NN
with	IN
``	NN
Chicken	IN
Soup	NN
''	IN
is	NN
not	IN
whether	NN
the	IN
pot	NN
will	IN
boil	NN
over	IN
,	NN
but	IN
whether	NN
it	IN
will	NN
simmer	IN
at	NN
all	IN
.	NN

So	IN
far	NN
,	IN
the	NN
bubbles	IN
have	NN
been	IN
few	NN
and	IN
far	NN
between	IN
.	NN

Part	IN
of	NN
the	IN
problem	NN
is	IN
the	NN
tendency	IN
of	NN
all	IN
sitcoms	NN
,	IN
ever	NN
since	IN
the	NN
didactic	IN
days	NN
of	IN
Norman	NN
Lear	IN
,	NN
to	IN
preach	NN
about	IN
social	NN
issues	IN
.	NN

To	IN
some	NN
extent	IN
,	NN
this	IN
tendency	NN
emerges	IN
whenever	NN
the	IN
show	NN
tries	IN
to	NN
enlighten	IN
us	NN
about	IN
ethnic	NN
stereotypes	IN
by	NN
reversing	IN
them	NN
.	IN

For	IN
instance	NN
,	IN
Michael	NN
dislikes	IN
Jackie	NN
not	IN
because	NN
he	IN
's	NN
a	IN
shrewd	NN
Jewish	IN
businessman	NN
,	IN
but	NN
because	IN
he	NN
quits	IN
his	NN
well-paying	IN
job	NN
as	IN
a	NN
salesman	IN
in	NN
order	IN
to	NN
become	IN
a	NN
social	IN
worker	NN
.	IN

Even	IN
more	NN
problematic	IN
is	NN
the	IN
incompatibility	NN
between	IN
sitcom	NN
preachiness	IN
and	NN
Mr.	IN
Mason	NN
's	IN
comic	NN
persona	IN
.	NN

The	IN
best	NN
moments	IN
in	NN
the	IN
show	NN
occur	IN
at	NN
the	IN
beginning	NN
and	IN
the	NN
end	IN
(	NN
and	IN
occasionally	NN
in	IN
the	NN
middle	IN
)	NN
,	IN
when	NN
Mr.	IN
Mason	NN
slips	IN
into	NN
his	IN
standup	NN
mode	IN
and	NN
starts	IN
meting	NN
out	IN
that	NN
old-fashioned	IN
Jewish	NN
mischief	IN
to	NN
other	IN
people	NN
as	IN
well	NN
as	IN
to	NN
himself	IN
.	NN

But	IN
too	NN
often	IN
,	NN
these	IN
routines	NN
lack	IN
spark	NN
because	IN
this	NN
sitcom	IN
,	NN
like	IN
all	NN
sitcoms	IN
,	NN
is	IN
timid	NN
about	IN
confronting	NN
Mr.	IN
Mason	NN
's	IN
stock	NN
in	IN
trade	NN
-	IN
ethnic	NN
differences	IN
.	NN

I	IN
'm	NN
not	IN
suggesting	NN
that	IN
the	NN
producers	IN
start	NN
putting	IN
together	NN
episodes	IN
about	NN
topics	IN
like	NN
the	IN
Catholic-Jewish	NN
dispute	IN
over	NN
the	IN
Carmelite	NN
convent	IN
at	NN
Auschwitz	IN
.	NN

That	IN
issue	NN
,	IN
like	NN
racial	IN
tensions	NN
in	IN
New	NN
York	IN
City	NN
,	IN
will	NN
have	IN
to	NN
cool	IN
down	NN
,	IN
not	NN
heat	IN
up	NN
,	IN
before	NN
it	IN
can	NN
simmer	IN
.	NN

But	IN
I	NN
am	IN
suggesting	NN
that	IN
they	NN
stop	IN
requiring	NN
Mr.	IN
Mason	NN
to	IN
interrupt	NN
his	IN
classic	NN
shtik	IN
with	NN
some	IN
line	NN
about	IN
``	NN

I	IN
disagree	NN
with	IN
the	NN
statement	IN

that	IN
one	NN
should	IN
not	NN
draw	IN
an	NN

Fifth	NN

The	IN
Fifth	NN

This	IN
privilege	NN

precludes	IN
the	NN
drawing	IN
of	NN
an	IN
adverse	NN

against	NN
a	IN

in	IN
a	NN

a	NN

can	NN
not	IN
comment	NN
on	IN
a	NN

``	NN

that	NN

that	IN

the	IN

doom	IN

when	IN
it	NN

it	IN
attempted	NN
to	IN
invade	NN
two	IN

problems	IN

the	IN

cost	IN
of	NN

the	NN
rising	IN

a	IN
rationale	NN
for	IN

to	IN
``	NN
a	IN

Two	IN

in	NN
the	IN

to	NN
refer	IN
them	NN

But	IN
eluding	NN

probe	NN
was	IN
the	NN
case	IN

Mr.	NN

funneled	NN

On	IN

Despite	IN
convincing	NN
arguments	IN
,	NN
it	IN
was	NN
never	IN
established	NN
that	IN
Mr.	NN
Papandreou	IN
personally	NN
ordered	IN

The	IN
central	NN
weakness	IN
of	NN

was	NN
pointed	IN
up	NN
especially	IN
well	NN
when	IN
discussions	NN
focused	IN
on	NN
arms	IN
deals	NN
and	IN
kickbacks	NN
.	IN

The	IN
coalition	NN
government	IN
tried	NN
to	IN
show	NN
that	IN
PASOK	NN
ministers	IN
had	NN
received	IN
hefty	NN
sums	IN
for	NN

Naturally	IN

neither	IN

could	NN
be	IN

(	IN

to	IN
various	NN
Greek	IN
officials	NN
for	IN

So	IN
it	NN
seems	IN
that	NN
Mr.	IN
Mitsotakis	NN
and	IN
his	NN
communist	IN
chums	NN
may	IN
have	NN
unwittingly	IN
served	NN
Mr.	IN

,	IN
whether	NN

can	IN

traipse	IN

while	NN
verbal	IN
high	NN
jinks	IN
alone	NN
wo	IN
n't	NN
help	IN
PASOK	NN
regain	IN
power	NN
,	IN
Mr.	NN
Papandreou	IN
should	NN
never	IN
be	NN
underestimated	IN
.	NN

First	IN
came	NN
his	IN
predictable	NN
fusillade	IN
:	NN
He	IN
charged	NN
the	IN
Coalition	NN
of	IN
the	NN
Left	IN
and	NN
Progress	IN
had	NN
sold	IN
out	NN
its	IN
leftist	NN
tenets	IN
by	NN
collaborating	IN
in	NN
a	IN
right-wing	NN
plot	IN
aimed	NN
at	IN
ousting	NN
PASOK	IN
and	NN
thwarting	IN
the	NN
course	IN
of	NN
socialism	IN
in	NN
Greece	IN
.	NN

Then	IN
,	NN
to	IN
buttress	NN
his	IN
credibility	NN
with	IN
the	NN
left	IN
,	NN
he	IN
enticed	NN
some	IN
smaller	NN
leftist	IN
parties	NN
to	IN
stand	NN
for	IN
election	NN
under	IN
the	NN
PASOK	IN
banner	NN
.	IN

Next	IN
,	NN
he	IN
continued	NN
to	IN
court	NN
the	IN
communists	NN
--	IN
many	NN
of	IN
whom	NN
feel	IN
betrayed	NN
by	IN
the	NN
left-right	IN
coalition	NN
's	IN
birth	NN
--	IN
by	NN
bringing	IN
into	NN
PASOK	IN
a	NN
well-respected	IN
Communist	NN
Party	IN
candidate	NN
.	IN

For	IN
balance	NN
,	IN
and	NN
in	IN
hopes	NN
of	IN
gaining	NN
some	IN
disaffected	NN
centrist	IN
votes	NN
,	IN
he	NN
managed	IN
to	NN
attract	IN
a	NN
former	IN
New	NN
Democracy	IN
Party	NN
representative	IN
and	NN
known	IN
political	NN
enemy	IN
of	NN
Mr.	IN
Mitsotakis	NN
.	IN

Thus	IN
PASOK	NN
heads	IN
for	NN
the	IN
polls	NN
not	IN
only	NN
with	IN
diminished	NN
scandal-stench	IN
,	NN
but	IN
also	NN
with	IN
``	NN

the	NN
matter	IN
awaits	NN
final	IN
approval	NN
from	IN

The	IN
Greeks	NN
seem	IN
barely	NN
aware	IN
of	NN
the	IN
importance	NN
of	IN
the	NN
case	IN
as	NN
a	IN
litmus	NN

That	IN

the	NN
possibility	IN

As	IN
the	NN
days	IN
go	NN
by	IN
,	NN
the	IN
South	NN
African	IN
government	NN
will	IN
be	NN
ever	IN
more	NN
hard	IN
pressed	NN
to	IN
justify	NN
the	IN
continued	NN
imprisonment	IN
of	NN
Mr.	IN
Mandela	NN
as	IN
well	NN
as	IN
the	NN
continued	IN

the	NN

the	IN

The	IN

will	IN
be	NN
under	IN

pressure	IN

The	IN
government	NN
is	IN
watching	NN
closely	IN

see	IN
if	NN
their	IN

Pretoria	NN
will	IN

this	IN

a	IN
reason	NN
to	IN
keep	NN
Mr.	IN

Pretoria	IN
has	NN

for	NN

In	IN
addition	NN
,	IN
the	NN
government	IN
is	NN
figuring	IN
that	NN
the	IN

could	IN
create	NN
a	IN
split	NN
between	IN
