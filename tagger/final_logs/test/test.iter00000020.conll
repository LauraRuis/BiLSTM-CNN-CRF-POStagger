After	NN
the	NN

that	NN
it	NN
would	NN
be	NN
wise	NN
to	NN
halt	NN
trading	NN
whenever	NN
panic	NN
conditions	NN
arose	NN
.	NN

The	NN
New	NN

Stock	NN
Exchange	NN
adopted	NN
two	NN
specific	NN
circuit	NN
breakers	NN
:	NN
If	NN
the	NN
Dow	NN
Jones	NN
index	NN
falls	NN
250	NN
points	NN
in	NN
a	NN
day	NN
,	NN
the	NN
exchange	NN
will	NN
halt	NN

one	NN
hour	NN

if	NN
the	NN
decline	NN
hits	NN
400	NN
points	NN
,	NN
the	NN
exchange	NN
will	NN
close	NN
for	NN
an	NN
additional	NN
two	NN
hours	NN
.	NN

The	NN
rationale	NN
is	NN
that	NN
an	NN
interruption	NN
of	NN
trading	NN
will	NN
allow	NN
investors	NN
to	NN
reconsider	NN
their	NN
strategies	NN
,	NN
calm	NN
sellers	NN
and	NN
lead	NN
buyers	NN
to	NN
enter	NN
the	NN
market	NN
at	NN
indicated	NN
new	NN
price	NN
levels	NN
.	NN

It	NN
is	NN
impossible	NN
to	NN
know	NN
whether	NN
that	NN
theory	NN
is	NN
realistic	NN
.	NN

A	NN
temporary	NN
cessation	NN
of	NN
trading	NN
may	NN
indeed	NN
discourage	NN
a	NN
selling	NN
panic	NN
from	NN
feeding	NN

itself	NN

there	NN
is	NN
also	NN
the	NN
possibility	NN
that	NN

intensify	NN
fears	NN

nothing	NN
to	NN
do	NN
with	NN
the	NN

what	NN
is	NN
going	NN
on	NN
?	NN

The	NN
first	NN

to	NN

of	NN
the	NN

seems	NN
to	NN
have	NN

a	NN

that	NN

according	NN
to	NN
Mr.	NN

Most	NN
analysts	NN

had	NN
expected	NN
a	NN

on	NN

transaction	NN
,	NN
which	NN
was	NN
announced	NN
in	NN

long	NN
before	NN

Many	NN
interpret	NN
the	NN

that	NN

about	NN
the	NN

CenTrust	NN

however	NN

the	NN

It	NN
said	NN
the	NN

would	NN
give	NN
it	NN
positive	NN

bringing	NN

Critics	NN

however	NN

say	NN
the	NN
branch	NN
sale	NN
will	NN
make	NN
CenTrust	NN
more	NN
dependent	NN

ever	NN
on	NN

Mr.	NN
Paul	NN
counters	NN
that	NN
he	NN
intends	NN
to	NN
further	NN
pare	NN
the	NN
size	NN
of	NN
CenTrust	NN

not	NN

Mr.	NN

remarks	NN
,	NN
quoted	NN
first	NN
in	NN
the	NN
Village	NN

was	NN

paid	NN

for	NN

and	NN
then	NN
in	NN
Newsweek	NN
after	NN
he	NN
and	NN
the	NN
campaign	NN
parted	NN
company	NN
.	NN

Mr.	NN
Mason	NN
said	NN
that	NN
many	NN
Jewish	NN
voters	NN
feel	NN
guilty	NN
toward	NN
blacks	NN
,	NN
so	NN
they	NN
support	NN
black	NN
candidates	NN
uncritically	NN
.	NN

He	NN
said	NN
that	NN
many	NN
black	NN
voters	NN
feel	NN
bitter	NN
about	NN
racial	NN
discrimination	NN
,	NN
so	NN
they	NN
,	NN
too	NN
,	NN
support	NN
black	NN
candidates	NN
uncritically	NN
.	NN

He	NN
said	NN
that	NN
Jews	NN
have	NN
contributed	NN
more	NN
to	NN
black	NN
causes	NN
over	NN
the	NN
years	NN
than	NN
vice	NN
versa	NN
.	NN

Of	NN
course	NN
,	NN
Mr.	NN
Mason	NN
did	NN
not	NN
use	NN
neutral	NN
language	NN
.	NN

As	NN
a	NN
practitioner	NN
of	NN
ethnic	NN
humor	NN
from	NN
the	NN
old	NN
days	NN
on	NN
the	NN
Borscht	NN
Belt	NN
,	NN
live	NN
television	NN
and	NN
the	NN
nightclub	NN
circuit	NN
,	NN
Mr.	NN
Mason	NN
instinctively	NN
reached	NN
for	NN
the	NN
vernacular	NN
.	NN

He	NN
said	NN
Jews	NN
were	NN
``	NN
sick	NN
with	NN
complexes	NN
''	NN
;	NN
and	NN
he	NN
called	NN
David	NN
Dinkins	NN
,	NN
Mr.	NN
Giuliani	NN
's	NN
black	NN
opponent	NN
,	NN
``	NN
a	NN
fancy	NN
shvartze	NN
with	NN
a	NN
mustache	NN
.	NN
''	NN

If	NN
Mr.	NN
Mason	NN
had	NN
used	NN
less	NN
derogatory	NN
language	NN
to	NN
articulate	NN
his	NN
amateur	NN
analysis	NN
of	NN
the	NN
voting	NN
behavior	NN
of	NN
his	NN
fellow	NN
New	NN
Yorkers	NN
,	NN
would	NN
the	NN
water	NN
be	NN
quite	NN
so	NN
hot	NN
?	NN

It	NN
probably	NN
would	NN
,	NN
because	NN
few	NN
or	NN
none	NN
of	NN
the	NN
people	NN
upset	NN
by	NN
Mr.	NN
Mason	NN
's	NN
remarks	NN
have	NN
bothered	NN
to	NN
distinguish	NN
between	NN
the	NN
substance	NN
of	NN
his	NN
comments	NN
and	NN
the	NN
fact	NN
that	NN
he	NN
used	NN
insulting	NN
language	NN
.	NN

In	NN
addition	NN
,	NN
some	NN
of	NN
Mr.	NN
Mason	NN
's	NN
critics	NN
have	NN
implied	NN
that	NN
his	NN
type	NN
of	NN
ethnic	NN
humor	NN
is	NN
itself	NN
a	NN
form	NN
of	NN
racism	NN
.	NN

For	NN
example	NN
,	NN
the	NN
New	NN
York	NN
state	NN
counsel	NN
for	NN
the	NN
NAACP	NN
said	NN
that	NN
Mr.	NN
Mason	NN
is	NN
``	NN
like	NN
a	NN
dinosaur	NN
.	NN

People	NN
are	NN
fast	NN
leaving	NN
the	NN
place	NN
where	NN
he	NN
is	NN
stuck	NN
.	NN
''	NN

These	NN
critics	NN
fail	NN
to	NN
distinguish	NN
between	NN
the	NN
type	NN
of	NN
ethnic	NN
humor	NN
that	NN
aims	NN
at	NN
disparaging	NN
another	NN
group	NN
,	NN
such	NN
as	NN
``	NN
Polish	NN
jokes	NN
''	NN
;	NN
and	NN
the	NN
type	NN
that	NN
is	NN
double-edged	NN
,	NN
aiming	NN
inward	NN
as	NN
well	NN
as	NN
outward	NN
.	NN

The	NN
latter	NN
typically	NN
is	NN
the	NN
humor	NN
of	NN
the	NN
underdog	NN
,	NN
and	NN
it	NN
was	NN
perfected	NN
by	NN
both	NN
blacks	NN
and	NN
Jews	NN
on	NN
the	NN
minstrel	NN
and	NN
vaudeville	NN
stage	NN
as	NN
a	NN
means	NN
of	NN
mocking	NN
their	NN
white	NN
and	NN
gentile	NN
audiences	NN
along	NN
with	NN
themselves	NN
.	NN

In	NN
the	NN
hands	NN
of	NN
a	NN
zealot	NN
like	NN
Lenny	NN
Bruce	NN
,	NN
this	NN
double-edged	NN
blade	NN
could	NN
cut	NN
both	NN
the	NN
self	NN
and	NN
the	NN
audience	NN
to	NN
ribbons	NN
.	NN

But	NN
wielded	NN
by	NN
a	NN
pro	NN
like	NN
Jackie	NN
Mason	NN
,	NN
it	NN
is	NN
a	NN
constructive	NN
form	NN
of	NN
mischief	NN
.	NN

Why	NN
constructive	NN
?	NN

Because	NN
despite	NN
all	NN
the	NN
media	NN
prattle	NN
about	NN
comedy	NN
and	NN
politics	NN
not	NN
mixing	NN
,	NN
they	NN
are	NN
similar	NN
in	NN
one	NN
respect	NN
:	NN
Both	NN
can	NN
serve	NN
as	NN
mechanisms	NN
for	NN
easing	NN
tensions	NN
and	NN
facilitating	NN
the	NN
co-existence	NN
of	NN
groups	NN
in	NN
conflict	NN
.	NN

That	NN
's	NN
why	NN
it	NN
's	NN
dangerous	NN
to	NN
have	NN
well-intentioned	NN
thought	NN
police	NN
,	NN
on	NN
college	NN
campuses	NN
and	NN
elsewhere	NN
,	NN
taboo	NN
all	NN
critical	NN
mention	NN
of	NN
group	NN
differences	NN
.	NN

As	NN
Elizabeth	NN
Kristol	NN
wrote	NN
in	NN
the	NN
New	NN

Times	NN
just	NN
before	NN
the	NN
Mason	NN

``	NN
Perhaps	NN

not	NN
boil	NN
over	NN
with	NN
such	NN
intensity	NN
if	NN
honest	NN

were	NN
allowed	NN
to	NN
simmer	NN
.	NN
''	NN

The	NN
question	NN
is	NN
,	NN
if	NN
group	NN
conflicts	NN
still	NN
exist	NN
(	NN
as	NN
undeniably	NN
they	NN
do	NN
)	NN
,	NN
and	NN
if	NN
Mr.	NN
Mason	NN
's	NN
type	NN
of	NN
ethnic	NN
humor	NN
is	NN
passe	NN
,	NN
then	NN
what	NN
other	NN
means	NN
do	NN
we	NN
have	NN
for	NN
letting	NN
off	NN
steam	NN
?	NN

Do	NN
n't	NN
say	NN
the	NN
TV	NN
sitcom	NN
,	NN
because	NN
that	NN
happens	NN
to	NN
be	NN
a	NN
genre	NN
that	NN
,	NN
in	NN
its	NN
desperate	NN
need	NN
to	NN
attract	NN
everybody	NN
and	NN
offend	NN
nobody	NN
,	NN
resembles	NN
politics	NN
more	NN
than	NN
it	NN
does	NN
comedy	NN
.	NN

It	NN
is	NN
true	NN
that	NN
the	NN
best	NN
sitcoms	NN
do	NN
allow	NN
group	NN
differences	NN
to	NN
simmer	NN
:	NN
yuppies	NN
vs.	NN
blue-collar	NN
Bostonians	NN
in	NN
``	NN
Cheers	NN
''	NN
;	NN
children	NN
vs.	NN
adults	NN
in	NN
``	NN
The	NN
Cosby	NN
Show	NN
.	NN
''	NN

But	NN
these	NN
are	NN
not	NN
the	NN
differences	NN
that	NN
make	NN
headlines	NN
.	NN

In	NN
``	NN
Chicken	NN
Soup	NN
,	NN
''	NN
Mr.	NN
Mason	NN
plays	NN
Jackie	NN
,	NN
a	NN
Jewish	NN
bachelor	NN
courting	NN
Maddie	NN
(	NN
Lynn	NN
Redgrave	NN
)	NN
,	NN
an	NN
Irish	NN
widow	NN
and	NN
mother	NN
of	NN

against	NN
the	NN

Rita	NN
Karin	NN
)	NN
and	NN
her	NN
brother	NN
Michael	NN
(	NN
Brandon	NN

.	NN

It	NN
's	NN
worth	NN
noting	NN
that	NN
both	NN
disapproving	NN
relatives	NN
are	NN
immigrants	NN
.	NN

At	NN

,	NN
they	NN
both	NN
speak	NN
with	NN
strong	NN
accents	NN
,	NN
as	NN
do	NN
Jackie	NN
and	NN
Maddie	NN
.	NN

It	NN
could	NN
n't	NN
be	NN
more	NN
obvious	NN
that	NN
``	NN
Chicken	NN
Soup	NN
''	NN
is	NN
being	NN
made	NN
from	NN
an	NN
old	NN
recipe	NN
.	NN

And	NN
a	NN
safe	NN
one	NN
--	NN
imagine	NN
if	NN
the	NN
romance	NN
in	NN
question	NN
were	NN
between	NN
an	NN
Orthodox	NN
Jew	NN
and	NN
a	NN
member	NN
of	NN
the	NN
Nation	NN
of	NN
Islam	NN
.	NN

Back	NN
in	NN
the	NN
1920s	NN
,	NN
the	NN
play	NN
and	NN
movie	NN
versions	NN
of	NN
``	NN
Abie	NN
's	NN
Irish	NN
Rose	NN
''	NN
made	NN
the	NN
theme	NN
of	NN
courtship	NN
between	NN
the	NN
assimilated	NN
offspring	NN
of	NN
Jewish	NN
and	NN
Irish	NN
immigrants	NN
so	NN
popular	NN
that	NN
its	NN
author	NN
,	NN
Anne	NN
Nichols	NN
,	NN
lost	NN
a	NN
plagiarism	NN
suit	NN
on	NN
the	NN
grounds	NN
that	NN
the	NN
plot	NN
has	NN
entered	NN
the	NN
public	NN
domain	NN
.	NN

And	NN
it	NN
has	NN
remained	NN
there	NN
,	NN
as	NN
evidenced	NN
by	NN
its	NN
reappearance	NN
in	NN
a	NN
1972	NN
CBS	NN
sitcom	NN
called	NN
``	NN
Bridget	NN
Loves	NN
Bernie	NN
,	NN
''	NN
whose	NN
sole	NN
distinction	NN
was	NN
that	NN
it	NN
led	NN
to	NN
the	NN
real-life	NN
marriage	NN
of	NN
Meredith	NN
Baxter	NN
and	NN
David	NN
Birney	NN
.	NN

Clearly	NN
,	NN
the	NN
question	NN
with	NN
``	NN
Chicken	NN
Soup	NN
''	NN
is	NN
not	NN
whether	NN
the	NN
pot	NN
will	NN
boil	NN
over	NN
,	NN
but	NN
whether	NN
it	NN
will	NN
simmer	NN
at	NN
all	NN
.	NN

So	NN
far	NN
,	NN
the	NN
bubbles	NN
have	NN
been	NN
few	NN
and	NN
far	NN
between	NN
.	NN

Part	NN
of	NN
the	NN
problem	NN
is	NN
the	NN
tendency	NN
of	NN
all	NN
sitcoms	NN
,	NN
ever	NN
since	NN
the	NN
didactic	NN
days	NN
of	NN
Norman	NN
Lear	NN
,	NN
to	NN
preach	NN
about	NN
social	NN
issues	NN
.	NN

To	NN
some	NN
extent	NN
,	NN
this	NN
tendency	NN
emerges	NN
whenever	NN
the	NN
show	NN
tries	NN
to	NN
enlighten	NN
us	NN
about	NN
ethnic	NN
stereotypes	NN
by	NN
reversing	NN
them	NN
.	NN

For	NN
instance	NN
,	NN
Michael	NN
dislikes	NN
Jackie	NN
not	NN
because	NN
he	NN
's	NN
a	NN
shrewd	NN
Jewish	NN
businessman	NN
,	NN
but	NN
because	NN
he	NN
quits	NN
his	NN
well-paying	NN
job	NN
as	NN
a	NN
salesman	NN
in	NN
order	NN
to	NN
become	NN
a	NN
social	NN
worker	NN
.	NN

Even	NN
more	NN
problematic	NN
is	NN
the	NN
incompatibility	NN
between	NN
sitcom	NN
preachiness	NN
and	NN
Mr.	NN
Mason	NN
's	NN
comic	NN
persona	NN
.	NN

The	NN
best	NN
moments	NN
in	NN
the	NN
show	NN
occur	NN
at	NN
the	NN
beginning	NN
and	NN
the	NN
end	NN
(	NN
and	NN
occasionally	NN
in	NN
the	NN
middle	NN
)	NN
,	NN
when	NN
Mr.	NN
Mason	NN
slips	NN
into	NN
his	NN
standup	NN
mode	NN
and	NN
starts	NN
meting	NN
out	NN
that	NN
old-fashioned	NN
Jewish	NN
mischief	NN
to	NN
other	NN
people	NN
as	NN
well	NN
as	NN
to	NN
himself	NN
.	NN

But	NN
too	NN
often	NN
,	NN
these	NN
routines	NN
lack	NN
spark	NN
because	NN
this	NN
sitcom	NN
,	NN
like	NN
all	NN
sitcoms	NN
,	NN
is	NN
timid	NN
about	NN
confronting	NN
Mr.	NN
Mason	NN
's	NN
stock	NN
in	NN
trade	NN
-	NN
ethnic	NN
differences	NN
.	NN

I	NN
'm	NN
not	NN
suggesting	NN
that	NN
the	NN
producers	NN
start	NN
putting	NN
together	NN
episodes	NN
about	NN
topics	NN
like	NN
the	NN
Catholic-Jewish	NN
dispute	NN
over	NN
the	NN
Carmelite	NN
convent	NN
at	NN
Auschwitz	NN
.	NN

That	NN
issue	NN
,	NN
like	NN
racial	NN
tensions	NN
in	NN
New	NN

City	NN
,	NN
will	NN
have	NN
to	NN
cool	NN
down	NN
,	NN
not	NN
heat	NN
up	NN
,	NN
before	NN
it	NN
can	NN
simmer	NN
.	NN

But	NN
I	NN
am	NN
suggesting	NN
that	NN
they	NN
stop	NN
requiring	NN
Mr.	NN
Mason	NN
to	NN
interrupt	NN
his	NN
classic	NN
shtik	NN
with	NN
some	NN
line	NN
about	NN
``	NN
caring	NN

I	NN
disagree	NN
with	NN
the	NN
statement	NN
by	NN
Mr.	NN

that	NN
one	NN
should	NN
not	NN
draw	NN
an	NN
adverse	NN

who	NN
assert	NN
their	NN
Fifth	NN
Amendment	NN
privilege	NN
against	NN
self-incrimination	NN
in	NN
congressional	NN
hearings	NN

The	NN
Fifth	NN
Amendment	NN
states	NN
in	NN

that	NN
no	NN
person	NN
``	NN

This	NN
privilege	NN
against	NN
self-incrimination	NN
precludes	NN
the	NN
drawing	NN
of	NN
an	NN
adverse	NN
inference	NN
against	NN
a	NN
criminal	NN
defendant	NN
who	NN
chooses	NN
not	NN

Thus	NN
,	NN
in	NN
a	NN
criminal	NN
case	NN
,	NN
a	NN
prosecutor	NN
can	NN
not	NN
comment	NN
on	NN
a	NN
defendant	NN

failure	NN

the	NN

``	NN

The	NN

``	NN

his	NN

Perhaps	NN
the	NN
explanation	NN
for	NN

is	NN
that	NN

that	NN

the	NN

doom	NN

the	NN

the	NN

when	NN
it	NN

was	NN
let	NN
loose	NN

it	NN
attempted	NN

invade	NN
two	NN

the	NN
rising	NN
cost	NN
of	NN

the	NN
rising	NN

``	NN
Service	NN
''	NN
should	NN
be	NN
service	NN
.	NN

As	NN
commonly	NN
understood	NN

service	NN
implies	NN
sacrifice	NN

involves	NN
accepting	NN
risk	NN

giving	NN
up	NN
income	NN

deferring	NN
a	NN
career	NN

follows	NN
that	NN
proposals	NN

Nunn-McCurdy	NN

whose	NN
benefits	NN

worth	NN
some	NN

17COMMA500	NN
a	NN
year	NN
,	NN
do	NN
not	NN
qualify	NN

There	NN
is	NN
a	NN
rationale	NN
for	NN
such	NN
bills	NN
:	NN
Federal	NN
subsidies	NN

students	NN
amount	NN
to	NN
``	NN
a	NN

those	NN
benefits	NN

the	NN

Among	NN
unanswered	NN

are	NN
whether	NN

received	NN

cut	NN
was	NN
from	NN
the	NN

Mr.	NN
Koskotas	NN
pinched	NN
.	NN

Two	NN
former	NN
ministers	NN
were	NN
so	NN
heavily	NN
implicated	NN
in	NN
the	NN
Koskotas	NN
affair	NN
that	NN
PASOK	NN
members	NN
of	NN
Parliament	NN
voted	NN
to	NN
refer	NN
them	NN
to	NN
the	NN
special	NN
court	NN
.	NN

But	NN
eluding	NN
parliamentary	NN
probe	NN
was	NN
the	NN
case	NN
of	NN
millions	NN
of	NN
drachmas	NN
Mr.	NN
Koskotas	NN
funneled	NN
into	NN
New	NN
Democracy	NN
coffers	NN
.	NN

In	NN
the	NN
end	NN
,	NN
the	NN
investigation	NN
produced	NN
only	NN
circumstantial	NN
evidence	NN

``	NN
indications	NN

that	NN
point	NN
to	NN
PASOK	NN

not	NN

On	NN
another	NN
issue	NN
,	NN
Greeks	NN
were	NN
told	NN
how	NN
their	NN
national	NN
intelligence	NN
agency	NN
,	NN
the	NN
EYP	NN
,	NN
regularly	NN
monitored	NN

including	NN
key	NN

journalists	NN
and	NN
PASOK	NN
cabinet	NN
members	NN
.	NN

Despite	NN
convincing	NN
arguments	NN
,	NN
it	NN
was	NN
never	NN
established	NN
that	NN
Mr.	NN
Papandreou	NN
personally	NN
ordered	NN
or	NN
directed	NN
the	NN
wiretaps	NN
.	NN

The	NN
central	NN
weakness	NN
of	NN
the	NN
``	NN
scandals	NN
''	NN
debates	NN
was	NN
pointed	NN
up	NN
especially	NN
well	NN
when	NN
discussions	NN
focused	NN
on	NN
arms	NN
deals	NN
and	NN
kickbacks	NN
.	NN

The	NN
coalition	NN
government	NN
tried	NN
to	NN
show	NN
that	NN
PASOK	NN
ministers	NN
had	NN
received	NN
hefty	NN
sums	NN
for	NN
OKing	NN
the	NN
purchase	NN
of	NN
F-16	NN

Naturally	NN

neither	NN
General	NN

nor	NN
Dassault	NN
could	NN
be	NN
expected	NN
to	NN
hamper	NN
its	NN

by	NN
making	NN

paid	NN
(	NN
or	NN
not	NN
)	NN
to	NN
various	NN
Greek	NN
officials	NN
for	NN
services	NN
rendered	NN

So	NN
it	NN
seems	NN
that	NN
Mr.	NN
Mitsotakis	NN
and	NN
his	NN
communist	NN
chums	NN
may	NN
have	NN
unwittingly	NN
served	NN
Mr.	NN
Papandreou	NN
a	NN
moral	NN
victory	NN
on	NN
a	NN
platter	NN
:	NN
PASOK	NN
,	NN
whether	NN
guilty	NN
or	NN
not	NN
,	NN
can	NN
now	NN
traipse	NN
the	NN
countryside	NN
condemning	NN

affair	NN
as	NN
a	NN
witch	NN

Mr.	NN

But	NN
while	NN
verbal	NN
high	NN
jinks	NN
alone	NN
wo	NN
n't	NN
help	NN
PASOK	NN
regain	NN
power	NN
,	NN
Mr.	NN
Papandreou	NN
should	NN
never	NN
be	NN
underestimated	NN
.	NN

First	NN
came	NN
his	NN
predictable	NN
fusillade	NN
:	NN
He	NN
charged	NN
the	NN
Coalition	NN
of	NN
the	NN
Left	NN
and	NN
Progress	NN
had	NN
sold	NN
out	NN
its	NN
leftist	NN
tenets	NN
by	NN
collaborating	NN
in	NN
a	NN
right-wing	NN
plot	NN
aimed	NN
at	NN
ousting	NN
PASOK	NN
and	NN
thwarting	NN
the	NN
course	NN
of	NN
socialism	NN
in	NN
Greece	NN
.	NN

Then	NN
,	NN
to	NN
buttress	NN
his	NN
credibility	NN
with	NN
the	NN
left	NN
,	NN
he	NN
enticed	NN
some	NN
smaller	NN
leftist	NN
parties	NN
to	NN
stand	NN
for	NN
election	NN
under	NN
the	NN
PASOK	NN
banner	NN
.	NN

Next	NN
,	NN
he	NN
continued	NN
to	NN
court	NN
the	NN
communists	NN
--	NN
many	NN
of	NN
whom	NN
feel	NN
betrayed	NN
by	NN
the	NN
left-right	NN
coalition	NN
's	NN
birth	NN
--	NN
by	NN
bringing	NN
into	NN
PASOK	NN
a	NN
well-respected	NN
Communist	NN
Party	NN
candidate	NN
.	NN

For	NN
balance	NN
,	NN
and	NN
in	NN
hopes	NN
of	NN
gaining	NN
some	NN
disaffected	NN
centrist	NN
votes	NN
,	NN
he	NN
managed	NN
to	NN
attract	NN
a	NN
former	NN
New	NN
Democracy	NN
Party	NN
representative	NN
and	NN
known	NN
political	NN
enemy	NN
of	NN
Mr.	NN
Mitsotakis	NN
.	NN

Thus	NN
PASOK	NN
heads	NN
for	NN
the	NN
polls	NN
not	NN
only	NN
with	NN
diminished	NN
scandal-stench	NN
,	NN
but	NN
also	NN
with	NN
``	NN

Greece	NN

pressing	NN
issues	NN

legislation	NN
in	NN

the	NN
matter	NN
awaits	NN
final	NN
approval	NN
from	NN

The	NN
Greeks	NN
seem	NN
barely	NN
aware	NN
of	NN
the	NN
importance	NN
of	NN
the	NN
case	NN
as	NN
a	NN
litmus	NN

out	NN

That	NN

Greek	NN
press	NN

Yet	NN
the	NN
possibility	NN
of	NN

As	NN
the	NN
days	NN
go	NN
by	NN

the	NN
South	NN
African	NN
government	NN
will	NN
be	NN
ever	NN
more	NN
hard	NN
pressed	NN
to	NN
justify	NN
the	NN
continued	NN
imprisonment	NN
of	NN
Mr.	NN
Mandela	NN
as	NN
well	NN
as	NN
the	NN
continued	NN
banning	NN

the	NN

the	NN

the	NN

the	NN

The	NN

ANC	NN

will	NN
be	NN
under	NN
enormous	NN
pressure	NN

The	NN
government	NN
is	NN
watching	NN
closely	NN
to	NN
see	NN
if	NN
their	NN

the	NN

if	NN

Pretoria	NN

use	NN
this	NN

a	NN
reason	NN
to	NN
keep	NN
Mr.	NN

Pretoria	NN
has	NN

the	NN

for	NN
sabotage	NN

the	NN

In	NN
addition	NN
,	NN
the	NN
government	NN
is	NN
figuring	NN
that	NN
the	NN

could	NN
create	NN
a	NN
split	NN
between	NN
the	NN
internal	NN

of	NN
the	NN
