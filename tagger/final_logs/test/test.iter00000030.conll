that	NN
it	IN

be	NN

halt	NN
trading	IN
whenever	NN

arose	NN
.	NN

The	NN
New	IN

Stock	NN
Exchange	IN
adopted	NN
two	NN
specific	NN
circuit	IN
breakers	NN
:	NN
If	IN
the	NN
Dow	NN
Jones	NN
index	IN
falls	NN
250	NN
points	IN
in	NN
a	NN
day	IN
,	NN
the	NN

if	NN

points	NN
,	NN
the	IN
exchange	NN
will	NN
close	IN
for	NN
an	NN
additional	IN
two	NN
hours	NN
.	NN

The	NN
rationale	IN
is	NN
that	NN
an	IN
interruption	NN
of	NN
trading	IN
will	NN
allow	NN
investors	NN
to	IN
reconsider	NN
their	NN
strategies	IN

calm	NN
sellers	IN
and	NN
lead	NN
buyers	IN
to	NN
enter	NN
the	IN
market	NN
at	NN
indicated	IN
new	NN
price	NN
levels	IN
.	NN

It	NN
is	IN
impossible	NN
to	NN
know	IN
whether	NN
that	NN
theory	IN

realistic	NN
.	NN

A	NN
temporary	IN
cessation	NN
of	NN
trading	IN
may	NN
indeed	NN
discourage	NN
a	IN
selling	NN
panic	NN
from	IN
feeding	NN

itself	NN

there	IN
is	NN
also	NN
the	IN
possibility	NN
that	NN

intensify	IN
fears	NN

even	NN

according	NN
to	IN
Mr.	NN

Most	NN

had	NN
expected	NN

,	NN
which	IN
was	NN
announced	NN
in	IN

long	IN

Many	NN
interpret	IN
the	NN

about	NN
the	NN

the	NN

make	NN
CenTrust	NN
more	IN

Mr.	NN
Paul	IN
counters	NN
that	NN

intends	NN
to	NN
further	NN
pare	IN
the	NN
size	NN

CenTrust	NN

The	NN

quoted	NN

Mr.	NN

said	NN
that	NN
many	IN
Jewish	NN

feel	IN
guilty	NN
toward	NN

,	IN
so	NN
they	NN
support	IN

He	NN
said	IN
that	NN
many	NN
black	IN

feel	NN
bitter	IN
about	NN

so	NN
they	IN
,	NN
too	NN
,	IN
support	NN
black	NN

He	NN
said	IN
that	NN
Jews	NN
have	IN
contributed	NN
more	NN
to	IN
black	NN

over	IN
the	NN
years	NN
than	IN
vice	NN

.	NN

Of	NN
course	IN
,	NN
Mr.	NN
Mason	IN
did	NN
not	NN
use	IN
neutral	NN
language	NN
.	NN

As	NN
a	IN
practitioner	NN
of	NN
ethnic	IN
humor	NN
from	NN
the	NN
old	IN
days	NN
on	NN
the	IN
Borscht	NN
Belt	NN
,	IN
live	NN
television	NN
and	IN
the	NN
nightclub	NN
circuit	IN
,	NN
Mr.	NN
Mason	IN
instinctively	NN
reached	NN
for	IN
the	NN
vernacular	NN
.	NN

He	NN
said	IN
Jews	NN
were	NN
``	NN
sick	IN
with	NN
complexes	NN
''	IN
;	NN
and	NN
he	NN
called	IN
David	NN
Dinkins	NN
,	IN
Mr.	NN

black	NN
opponent	NN
,	IN
``	NN
a	NN
fancy	IN
shvartze	NN
with	NN
a	IN
mustache	NN
.	NN
''	NN

If	NN
Mr.	IN
Mason	NN
had	NN
used	IN
less	NN
derogatory	NN
language	IN
to	NN
articulate	NN
his	IN
amateur	NN
analysis	NN
of	IN
the	NN
voting	NN
behavior	IN
of	NN
his	NN
fellow	IN
New	NN
Yorkers	NN
,	IN
would	NN
the	NN
water	IN
be	NN
quite	NN
so	IN
hot	NN
?	NN

It	NN
probably	IN
would	NN
,	NN
because	IN
few	NN
or	NN
none	IN
of	NN
the	NN
people	NN
upset	IN
by	NN
Mr.	NN
Mason	IN
's	NN
remarks	NN
have	IN
bothered	NN
to	NN
distinguish	IN
between	NN
the	NN
substance	IN
of	NN
his	NN
comments	IN
and	NN
the	NN
fact	IN
that	NN
he	NN
used	IN
insulting	NN
language	NN
.	NN

In	NN
addition	IN
,	NN
some	NN
of	IN
Mr.	NN
Mason	NN
's	IN
critics	NN
have	NN
implied	IN
that	NN
his	NN
type	IN
of	NN
ethnic	NN
humor	IN
is	NN
itself	NN
a	IN
form	NN
of	NN
racism	IN
.	NN

For	NN
example	IN
,	NN
the	NN
New	IN
York	NN
state	NN
counsel	IN
for	NN
the	NN
NAACP	NN
said	IN
that	NN
Mr.	NN
Mason	IN
is	NN
``	NN
like	IN
a	NN
dinosaur	NN
.	NN

People	NN
are	IN
fast	NN
leaving	NN
the	IN
place	NN
where	NN
he	IN
is	NN
stuck	NN
.	NN
''	IN

These	NN
critics	IN
fail	NN
to	NN
distinguish	IN
between	NN
the	NN
type	IN
of	NN
ethnic	NN
humor	IN
that	NN
aims	NN
at	IN
disparaging	NN
another	NN
group	IN
,	NN
such	NN
as	IN
``	NN
Polish	NN
jokes	IN
''	NN
;	NN
and	IN
the	NN
type	NN
that	IN
is	NN
double-edged	NN
,	IN
aiming	NN
inward	NN
as	IN
well	NN
as	NN
outward	IN
.	NN

The	NN
latter	IN
typically	NN
is	NN
the	IN
humor	NN
of	NN
the	IN
underdog	NN
,	NN
and	IN
it	NN
was	NN
perfected	IN
by	NN
both	NN
blacks	IN
and	NN
Jews	NN
on	IN
the	NN
minstrel	NN
and	IN
vaudeville	NN
stage	NN
as	IN
a	NN
means	NN
of	IN
mocking	NN
their	NN
white	IN
and	NN
gentile	NN
audiences	IN
along	NN
with	NN
themselves	IN
.	NN

In	NN
the	IN
hands	NN
of	NN
a	IN
zealot	NN
like	NN
Lenny	NN
Bruce	IN
,	NN
this	NN
double-edged	IN
blade	NN
could	NN
cut	IN
both	NN
the	NN
self	IN
and	NN
the	NN
audience	IN
to	NN
ribbons	NN
.	NN

But	NN
wielded	IN
by	NN
a	NN
pro	IN
like	NN
Jackie	NN
Mason	NN
,	IN
it	NN
is	NN
a	IN
constructive	NN
form	NN
of	IN
mischief	NN
.	NN

Why	NN
constructive	IN
?	NN

Because	NN
despite	IN
all	NN
the	NN
media	IN
prattle	NN
about	NN
comedy	NN
and	IN
politics	NN
not	NN
mixing	IN
,	NN
they	NN
are	IN
similar	NN
in	NN
one	IN
respect	NN
:	NN
Both	IN
can	NN
serve	NN
as	IN
mechanisms	NN
for	NN
easing	IN
tensions	NN
and	NN
facilitating	IN
the	NN
co-existence	NN
of	IN
groups	NN
in	NN
conflict	IN
.	NN

That	NN
's	IN
why	NN
it	NN
's	IN
dangerous	NN
to	NN
have	IN
well-intentioned	NN
thought	NN
police	NN
,	IN
on	NN
college	NN
campuses	IN
and	NN
elsewhere	NN
,	IN
taboo	NN
all	NN
critical	IN
mention	NN
of	NN
group	IN
differences	NN
.	NN

As	NN
Elizabeth	IN
Kristol	NN
wrote	NN
in	IN
the	NN
New	NN

Times	NN
just	NN
before	IN
the	NN
Mason	NN

``	NN
Perhaps	IN

such	NN
intensity	NN
if	IN

allowed	NN
to	NN
simmer	IN
.	NN
''	NN

The	NN
question	IN
is	NN
,	NN
if	IN
group	NN
conflicts	NN
still	NN
exist	IN
(	NN
as	NN
undeniably	IN
they	NN
do	NN
)	IN
,	NN
and	NN
if	IN
Mr.	NN
Mason	NN
's	IN
type	NN
of	NN
ethnic	IN
humor	NN
is	NN
passe	IN
,	NN
then	NN
what	IN
other	NN
means	NN
do	IN
we	NN
have	NN
for	IN
letting	NN
off	NN
steam	IN
?	NN

Do	NN
n't	IN
say	NN
the	NN
TV	IN
sitcom	NN
,	NN
because	IN
that	NN
happens	NN
to	IN
be	NN
a	NN
genre	IN
that	NN
,	NN
in	IN
its	NN
desperate	NN
need	IN
to	NN
attract	NN
everybody	IN
and	NN
offend	NN
nobody	IN
,	NN
resembles	NN
politics	IN
more	NN
than	NN
it	IN
does	NN
comedy	NN
.	NN

It	NN
is	IN
true	NN
that	NN
the	IN
best	NN
sitcoms	NN
do	NN
allow	IN
group	NN
differences	NN
to	IN
simmer	NN
:	NN
yuppies	IN
vs.	NN
blue-collar	NN
Bostonians	IN
in	NN
``	NN

''	NN
;	NN
children	IN
vs.	NN
adults	NN
in	IN
``	NN
The	NN
Cosby	IN
Show	NN
.	NN
''	NN

But	NN
these	IN
are	NN
not	NN
the	IN
differences	NN
that	NN
make	IN
headlines	NN
.	NN

In	NN
``	IN
Chicken	NN

Mr.	NN
Mason	NN
plays	IN
Jackie	NN

It	NN
's	IN

that	IN

they	NN
both	IN

strong	NN

as	NN
do	IN
Jackie	NN

It	NN
could	IN

be	NN
more	IN
obvious	NN
that	NN
``	IN
Chicken	NN

is	IN
being	NN
made	NN
from	IN
an	NN

And	NN
a	IN
safe	NN
one	NN
--	IN
imagine	NN
if	NN
the	NN
romance	IN
in	NN
question	NN
were	IN
between	NN
an	NN
Orthodox	NN
Jew	IN
and	NN
a	NN
member	IN
of	NN
the	NN
Nation	IN
of	NN
Islam	NN
.	NN

Back	NN
in	IN
the	NN
1920s	NN
,	IN
the	NN
play	NN
and	IN
movie	NN
versions	NN
of	NN
``	IN
Abie	NN

made	IN
the	NN
theme	NN
of	IN
courtship	NN
between	NN
the	IN
assimilated	NN
offspring	NN
of	IN
Jewish	NN
and	NN
Irish	IN
immigrants	NN
so	NN
popular	IN
that	NN
its	NN
author	IN

Anne	NN

,	NN
lost	NN
a	IN

suit	NN
on	IN
the	NN
grounds	NN
that	IN
the	NN
plot	NN
has	IN
entered	NN
the	NN
public	IN
domain	NN
.	NN

And	NN
it	IN
has	NN
remained	NN
there	IN
,	NN
as	NN
evidenced	IN
by	NN
its	NN
reappearance	IN
in	NN
a	NN
1972	NN
CBS	IN
sitcom	NN
called	NN
``	IN
Bridget	NN
Loves	NN
Bernie	IN
,	NN
''	NN
whose	IN
sole	NN
distinction	NN
was	IN
that	NN
it	NN
led	IN
to	NN
the	NN
real-life	IN
marriage	NN
of	NN
Meredith	IN
Baxter	NN
and	NN
David	IN
Birney	NN
.	NN

Clearly	NN
,	IN
the	NN
question	NN
with	IN
``	NN
Chicken	NN
Soup	IN
''	NN
is	NN
not	NN
whether	IN
the	NN
pot	NN
will	IN
boil	NN
over	NN
,	IN
but	NN
whether	NN
it	IN
will	NN
simmer	NN
at	IN
all	NN
.	NN

So	NN
far	IN
,	NN
the	NN
bubbles	IN
have	NN
been	NN
few	NN
and	IN
far	NN
between	NN
.	NN

Part	NN
of	IN
the	NN
problem	NN
is	IN
the	NN
tendency	NN
of	IN
all	NN
sitcoms	NN
,	NN
ever	IN
since	NN
the	NN
didactic	IN
days	NN
of	NN
Norman	IN
Lear	NN
,	NN
to	IN
preach	NN
about	NN
social	IN
issues	NN
.	NN

To	NN
some	IN
extent	NN
,	NN
this	IN
tendency	NN
emerges	NN
whenever	IN
the	NN
show	NN
tries	IN
to	NN
enlighten	NN
us	IN
about	NN
ethnic	NN
stereotypes	IN
by	NN
reversing	NN
them	IN
.	NN

For	NN
instance	IN
,	NN
Michael	NN
dislikes	IN
Jackie	NN
not	NN
because	NN
he	IN
's	NN
a	NN
shrewd	IN
Jewish	NN
businessman	NN
,	IN
but	NN
because	NN
he	IN
quits	NN
his	NN
well-paying	IN
job	NN
as	NN
a	IN
salesman	NN
in	NN
order	IN
to	NN
become	NN
a	IN
social	NN
worker	NN
.	NN

Even	NN
more	IN
problematic	NN
is	NN
the	IN
incompatibility	NN
between	NN
sitcom	IN
preachiness	NN
and	NN
Mr.	IN
Mason	NN
's	NN
comic	IN
persona	NN
.	NN

The	NN
best	IN
moments	NN
in	NN
the	IN
show	NN
occur	NN
at	NN
the	IN
beginning	NN
and	NN
the	IN
end	NN
(	NN
and	IN
occasionally	NN
in	NN
the	IN
middle	NN
)	NN
,	IN
when	NN
Mr.	NN
Mason	IN
slips	NN
into	NN
his	IN
standup	NN
mode	NN
and	IN
starts	NN
meting	NN
out	IN
that	NN
old-fashioned	NN
Jewish	IN
mischief	NN
to	NN
other	IN
people	NN
as	NN
well	IN
as	NN
to	NN
himself	IN
.	NN

But	NN
too	IN
often	NN
,	NN
these	IN
routines	NN
lack	NN
spark	IN
because	NN
this	NN
sitcom	IN
,	NN
like	NN
all	IN
sitcoms	NN
,	NN
is	IN
timid	NN
about	NN
confronting	IN
Mr.	NN
Mason	NN
's	IN
stock	NN
in	NN
trade	IN
-	NN
ethnic	NN
differences	IN
.	NN

I	NN
'm	IN
not	NN
suggesting	NN
that	IN
the	NN
producers	NN
start	IN
putting	NN
together	NN
episodes	NN
about	IN
topics	NN
like	NN
the	IN
Catholic-Jewish	NN
dispute	NN
over	IN
the	NN
Carmelite	NN
convent	IN
at	NN
Auschwitz	NN
.	NN

That	NN
issue	IN
,	NN
like	NN
racial	IN
tensions	NN
in	NN
New	IN

will	NN
have	NN
to	IN
cool	NN
down	NN
,	IN
not	NN
heat	NN
up	IN
,	NN
before	NN
it	IN
can	NN
simmer	NN
.	NN

But	NN
I	IN
am	NN
suggesting	NN
that	IN
they	NN
stop	NN
requiring	IN
Mr.	NN
Mason	NN
to	NN
interrupt	IN
his	NN
classic	NN
shtik	IN
with	NN
some	NN
line	IN
about	NN
``	NN

the	IN

The	NN

I	NN
disagree	IN
with	NN
the	NN
statement	IN
by	NN
Mr.	NN

that	IN
one	NN
should	NN
not	IN
draw	NN
an	NN
adverse	NN

assert	IN
their	NN
Fifth	NN
Amendment	IN
privilege	NN
against	NN

in	NN
congressional	NN
hearings	IN

The	NN
Fifth	IN

states	NN
in	IN

that	NN
no	IN
person	NN
``	NN

This	NN
privilege	IN
against	NN
self-incrimination	NN
precludes	IN
the	NN
drawing	NN
of	IN
an	NN
adverse	NN
inference	NN
against	IN
a	NN
criminal	NN
defendant	IN
who	NN
chooses	NN
not	IN

Thus	NN
,	IN
in	NN
a	NN
criminal	IN
case	NN
,	NN
a	IN
prosecutor	NN
can	NN
not	NN
comment	IN
on	NN
a	NN
defendant	IN

failure	NN

the	NN

``	NN

The	NN

``	NN

Two	NN

But	NN
eluding	IN

probe	NN
was	IN
the	NN
case	NN

millions	NN

Mr.	IN
Koskotas	NN
funneled	NN
into	IN
New	NN

In	NN
the	IN

the	IN

``	IN

On	NN
another	IN

Greeks	IN
were	NN

PASOK	IN

Despite	NN
convincing	IN
arguments	NN
,	NN
it	IN
was	NN
never	NN
established	IN
that	NN
Mr.	NN
Papandreou	NN
personally	IN
ordered	NN

the	NN
wiretaps	NN

The	NN
central	IN
weakness	NN
of	NN

was	NN
pointed	NN
up	IN
especially	NN
well	NN
when	IN
discussions	NN
focused	NN
on	IN
arms	NN
deals	NN
and	IN
kickbacks	NN
.	NN

The	NN
coalition	IN
government	NN
tried	NN
to	IN
show	NN
that	NN
PASOK	IN
ministers	NN
had	NN
received	IN
hefty	NN
sums	NN
for	IN

the	NN

Naturally	NN

neither	NN

could	NN
be	IN

(	NN

to	IN
various	NN
Greek	NN

So	NN
it	IN
seems	NN
that	NN
Mr.	IN
Mitsotakis	NN
and	NN
his	IN
communist	NN
chums	NN
may	NN
have	IN
unwittingly	NN
served	NN
Mr.	IN

,	NN
whether	NN

can	NN

traipse	IN

as	NN
a	NN

But	NN
while	IN
verbal	NN
high	NN
jinks	IN
alone	NN
wo	NN
n't	NN
help	IN
PASOK	NN
regain	NN
power	IN
,	NN
Mr.	NN
Papandreou	IN
should	NN
never	NN
be	IN
underestimated	NN
.	NN

First	NN
came	IN
his	NN
predictable	NN
fusillade	IN
:	NN
He	NN
charged	NN
the	IN
Coalition	NN
of	NN
the	IN
Left	NN
and	NN
Progress	IN
had	NN
sold	NN
out	IN
its	NN
leftist	NN
tenets	IN
by	NN
collaborating	NN
in	IN
a	NN
right-wing	NN
plot	IN
aimed	NN
at	NN
ousting	IN
PASOK	NN
and	NN
thwarting	IN
the	NN
course	NN
of	IN
socialism	NN
in	NN
Greece	IN
.	NN

Then	NN
,	IN
to	NN
buttress	NN
his	IN
credibility	NN
with	NN
the	IN
left	NN
,	NN
he	NN
enticed	IN
some	NN
smaller	NN
leftist	IN
parties	NN
to	NN
stand	IN
for	NN
election	NN
under	IN
the	NN
PASOK	NN
banner	IN
.	NN

Next	NN
,	IN
he	NN
continued	NN
to	IN
court	NN
the	NN
communists	NN
--	IN
many	NN
of	NN
whom	IN
feel	NN
betrayed	NN
by	IN
the	NN
left-right	NN
coalition	IN

birth	NN
--	IN
by	NN
bringing	NN
into	IN
PASOK	NN
a	NN
well-respected	IN
Communist	NN
Party	NN
candidate	IN
.	NN

For	NN
balance	IN
,	NN
and	NN
in	IN
hopes	NN
of	NN
gaining	IN
some	NN
disaffected	NN
centrist	NN
votes	IN
,	NN
he	NN
managed	IN
to	NN
attract	NN
a	IN
former	NN
New	NN
Democracy	IN
Party	NN
representative	NN
and	IN
known	NN
political	NN
enemy	IN
of	NN
Mr.	NN
Mitsotakis	IN
.	NN

Thus	NN
PASOK	IN
heads	NN
for	NN
the	IN
polls	NN
not	NN
only	IN
with	NN
diminished	NN
scandal-stench	NN
,	IN
but	NN
also	NN
with	IN

seem	NN

the	NN

a	NN

As	NN

the	NN
South	IN
African	NN
government	NN
will	IN
be	NN
ever	NN
more	IN
hard	NN
pressed	NN
to	IN

the	NN
continued	IN

The	NN

watching	NN

Pretoria	NN

In	NN

the	NN

figuring	NN
that	IN
