he	NN

Reasons	NN
for	IN
the	NN
collapse	NN
of	IN
the	NN
Nimitz	NN
Freeway	IN
were	NN
sketchy	NN
yesterday	NN
.	IN

But	NN
most	IN
structural	NN
engineers	NN
attributed	IN
the	NN
destruction	NN
to	IN
improper	NN
reinforcement	NN
of	IN
the	NN
columns	NN
that	IN
supported	NN
the	NN
decks	IN
,	NN
and	NN
the	IN
fact	NN
that	NN
the	IN
ground	NN
beneath	NN
the	IN
highway	NN
is	NN
largely	IN
landfill	NN
and	NN
can	IN
become	NN
unstable	NN
,	IN
or	NN
``	NN
liquefy	IN
,	NN
''	NN
in	IN
a	NN
major	NN
quake	NN

The	NN
two-story	IN
roadway	NN
,	NN
designed	IN
in	NN
the	NN
mid-1940s	IN
and	NN
completed	NN
in	IN
1957	NN
,	NN
was	NN
supported	IN
by	NN
columns	NN
that	IN
apparently	NN
lacked	NN
the	IN
kind	NN
of	NN
steel	IN
reinforcement	NN
used	NN
in	IN
highways	NN
today	NN
.	NN

While	NN
the	IN
pillars	NN
did	NN
have	IN
long	NN
metal	NN
bars	IN
running	NN
vertically	NN
through	NN
them	IN
for	NN
reinforcement	NN
,	IN
they	NN
apparently	NN
lacked	IN
an	NN
adequate	NN
number	IN
of	NN
metal	NN
``	IN
ties	NN
''	NN
that	IN
run	NN
horizontally	NN
through	IN
the	NN

said	NN
Leo	NN
Parker	IN

a	NN
structural	IN
engineer	NN
in	NN
Los	IN

Caltrans	NN
today	IN
uses	NN
a	NN
variation	IN
of	NN
the	NN
design	IN
Mr.	NN
Parker	NN
describes	IN
,	NN
with	NN
spiraling	IN
steel	NN
rods	NN
inside	IN

But	NN
in	IN
the	NN
case	NN
of	IN
the	NN
Nimitz	NN
Freeway	IN
,	NN
the	NN
lack	IN
of	NN
such	NN
support	IN
caused	NN
the	NN
core	IN
of	NN
the	NN
columns	IN
to	NN
crumble	NN
and	IN
buckle	NN
under	NN
the	IN
weight	NN
of	NN
the	IN

Officials	NN
of	IN
the	NN
state	NN
agency	IN
did	NN
n't	NN
have	IN
any	NN
immediate	NN
explanation	IN
why	NN
the	NN
reinforcement	IN
did	NN
n't	NN
hold	IN
up	NN

Caltrans	NN
reinforced	IN
the	NN
highway	NN
in	IN
1977	NN
as	NN
part	NN
of	IN
a	NN
$	NN
55	IN

to	NN
tie	IN
the	NN

to	IN
the	NN
columns	NN
and	IN
prevent	NN
the	NN

from	NN
swaying	NN
in	IN
a	NN
quake	NN

Caltrans	NN
spokesman	IN
Jim	NN

in	IN

declined	NN
to	IN
identify	NN
the	NN
engineering	NN
firm	IN
that	NN
did	NN
the	IN
reinforcement	NN
work	NN
.	NN

Liability	NN
in	IN
the	NN
bridge	NN
and	IN
road	NN
collapses	NN
will	IN
revolve	NN
around	NN
whether	NN

``	NN

Mr.	NN

opponents	NN
chose	IN

held	NN
it	NN

kept	NN
it	NN

Yet	NN
with	IN
the	NN
smooth	NN

of	NN
Anthony	NN
Kennedy	NN
,	IN
an	NN
``	NN
80	IN

''	NN
only	IN
slightly	NN
less	NN

Mr.	NN

,	NN
the	NN
Democrats	IN
may	NN
have	NN
won	IN
the	NN
battle	NN
but	IN
lost	NN
the	NN
war	IN
.	NN

Another	NN
upshot	IN
,	NN
however	NN
,	IN
was	NN
the	NN
chilling	IN
message	NN
the	NN
Bork	NN
hearings	IN
sent	NN
into	NN
the	IN
judicial	NN
culture	NN
from	IN
which	NN
the	NN
Supreme	IN
Court	NN
draws	NN
its	IN
talent	NN
.	NN

The	NN
word	IN
went	NN
forth	NN
to	IN
every	NN
law	NN
school	IN
that	NN
those	NN
with	IN
federal	NN

must	NN
travel	NN
a	IN

with	NN
no	IN

and	IN
no	NN
bite	NN
to	IN
their	NN
tongue	NN

Unfortunately	NN
,	IN
the	NN
author	NN

supply	NN
the	IN
philosophical	NN
frame	NN
to	IN
sustain	NN
his	NN
reportorial	IN
talents	NN

He	NN
has	IN
too	NN
readily	NN
swallowed	IN
the	NN
case	NN
for	IN

Probing	NN
more	IN
deeply	NN
into	NN
the	IN
doctrine	NN
of	NN
``	IN

,	IN
''	NN
he	NN
would	IN
have	NN
found	NN
a	IN
long	NN
history	NN
going	IN
back	NN
to	NN
the	IN
great	NN

would	IN

subtle	NN
constitutional	IN
scholar	NN

Mr.	NN

Mr.	IN

Still	NN
,	IN
the	NN
long	NN
view	IN
of	NN
Robert	NN
Bork	NN
as	IN
constitutional	NN
thinker	NN
must	IN
be	NN
a	NN
spotty	IN
one	NN

His	NN
strength	IN
lies	NN
in	NN
his	IN
majoritarian	NN
doctrine	NN
,	IN
which	NN
keeps	NN
the	IN
Court	NN
clear	NN
of	IN
transient	NN
group	NN
pressures	IN
and	NN
leaves	NN
most	IN
decisions	NN
in	NN
a	IN
democracy	NN
to	NN
elected	IN
legislatures	NN
and	NN

Unfortunately	NN
,	IN
Mr.	NN
Bork	NN
failed	IN
to	NN
distinguish	NN
between	IN
such	NN
pressures	NN
and	NN
the	IN
emergence	NN
of	NN
great	IN
issues	NN
critical	NN
to	IN
a	NN
society	NN
that	IN
must	NN
be	NN
settled	IN

fear	NN
that	IN

that	NN

would	NN

bad	NN
for	NN

The	NN
counter-argument	IN

which	NN
he	IN

heard	NN

is	NN
that	NN
if	IN

successful	NN
in	NN
killing	IN

the	IN

will	IN
open	NN
up	NN
tremendously	IN
in	NN

The	NN
accompanying	IN
table	NN

how	IN
this	NN

would	IN
work	NN
for	NN
three	IN
stocks	NN

Though	NN
not	IN
reflected	NN
in	NN
the	IN
table	NN
,	NN
an	IN
investor	NN
should	NN
know	NN
that	IN
the	NN
cost	NN
of	IN
the	NN
option	NN
insurance	IN
can	NN
be	NN
partially	IN
offset	NN
by	NN
any	IN
dividends	NN
that	NN
the	IN
stock	NN
pays	NN
.	NN

For	NN
example	IN
,	NN
Tenneco	NN
Inc.	IN
pays	NN
a	NN
quarterly	NN
dividend	IN
of	NN
76	NN
cents	IN
,	NN
which	NN
would	IN
be	NN
received	NN
before	IN
the	NN
February	NN
option	IN
expires	NN
and	NN
,	IN
thus	NN
,	NN
reduce	IN
the	NN
cost	NN
of	IN
using	NN
the	NN
technique	IN
by	NN
that	NN
amount	IN
.	NN

In	NN
this	IN
case	NN
,	NN
the	IN
investor	NN
's	NN
risk	NN
would	IN
n't	NN
exceed	NN
3.6	IN
%	NN
of	NN
the	IN
total	NN
investment	NN
.	NN

To	NN
simplify	IN
the	NN
calculations	NN
,	IN
commissions	NN
on	NN
the	IN
option	NN
and	NN
underlying	IN
stock	NN
are	NN
n't	NN
included	IN
in	NN
the	NN
table	IN
.	NN

There	NN
are	IN
more	NN
than	NN
650	IN
stocks	NN
on	NN
which	NN
options	IN
may	NN
be	NN
bought	IN
and	NN
sold	NN
,	IN
including	NN
some	NN
over-the-counter	IN
stocks	NN
.	NN

But	NN
some	IN
investors	NN
might	NN
prefer	IN
a	NN
simpler	NN
strategy	IN
then	NN
hedging	NN
their	IN
individual	NN
holdings	NN
.	NN

They	NN
can	IN
do	NN
this	NN
by	IN
purchasing	NN
``	NN
index	IN
puts	NN
,	NN
''	NN
which	IN
are	NN
simply	NN
put	IN
options	NN
on	NN
indexes	IN
that	NN
match	NN
broad	IN
baskets	NN
of	NN
stocks	NN
.	IN

For	NN
instance	IN
,	NN
the	NN
most	IN
popular	NN
index	NN
option	IN
is	NN
the	NN
S&P	NN
100	IN
option	NN
,	NN
commonly	IN
called	NN
the	NN
OEX	NN
.	IN

It	NN
is	IN
based	NN
on	NN
the	IN
stocks	NN
that	NN
make	IN
up	NN
Standard	NN
&	NN
Poor	IN
's	NN
100-stock	NN
index	IN
.	NN

Unlike	NN
options	IN
on	NN
individual	NN
issues	IN
,	NN
index	NN
options	NN
are	IN
settled	NN
only	NN
in	IN
cash	NN
,	NN
and	IN
no	NN
stock	NN
is	IN
ever	NN
tendered	NN
.	NN

But	NN
while	IN
index	NN
options	NN
are	IN
convenient	NN
,	NN
they	IN
have	NN
several	NN
disadvantages	NN
.	IN

For	NN
one	IN
thing	NN
,	NN
an	IN
investor	NN
's	NN
portfolio	IN
might	NN
not	NN
closely	NN
match	IN
the	NN
S&P	NN
100	IN
.	NN

As	NN
a	IN
result	NN
,	NN
the	IN
OEX	NN
insurance	NN
may	NN
or	IN
may	NN
not	NN
fully	IN
protect	NN
an	NN
investor	IN
's	NN
holdings	NN
in	IN
the	NN
event	NN
of	IN
a	NN
market	NN
decline	IN
.	NN

In	NN
addition	IN
,	NN
OEX	NN
options	IN
were	NN
suspended	NN
from	NN
trading	IN
last	NN
Friday	NN
afternoon	IN
,	NN
after	NN
the	IN
stock-market	NN
sell-off	NN
got	IN
under	NN
way	NN
and	IN
trading	NN
in	NN
the	IN
S&P-500	NN
futures	NN
contract	IN
was	NN
halted	NN
.	NN

So	NN
an	IN
investor	NN
who	NN
wanted	IN
to	NN
realize	NN
a	IN
profit	NN
on	NN
OEX	NN
puts	IN
after	NN
the	NN
trading	IN
suspension	NN
would	NN
have	IN
been	NN
out	NN
of	IN
luck	NN
.	NN

On	NN
the	IN
other	NN
hand	NN
,	IN
only	NN
a	NN
handful	IN
of	NN
individual	NN
issues	NN
were	IN
suspended	NN
from	NN
trading	IN
on	NN
Friday	NN
.	NN

Normally	NN
,	IN
once	NN
the	NN
underlying	IN
investment	NN
is	NN
suspended	NN
from	IN
trading	NN
,	NN
the	IN
options	NN
on	NN
those	IN
investments	NN
also	NN
do	IN
n't	NN
trade	NN
.	NN

Ultimately	NN
,	IN
whether	NN
the	NN
insurance	IN
provided	NN
by	NN
purchasing	NN
puts	IN
is	NN
worthwhile	NN
depends	IN
on	NN
the	NN
cost	IN
of	NN
the	NN
options	IN
.	NN

That	NN
cost	IN
rises	NN
in	NN
times	IN
of	NN
high	NN
market	IN
volatility	NN
.	NN

But	NN
it	IN
still	NN
might	NN
be	IN
cheaper	NN
than	NN
taking	IN
a	NN
major	NN
hit	NN
.	IN

The	NN
protection	IN
from	NN
using	NN
married	IN
puts	NN
is	NN
clearly	IN
superior	NN
to	NN
that	IN
afforded	NN
by	NN
another	IN
options	NN
strategy	NN
some	IN
investors	NN
consider	NN
using	IN
during	NN
troubled	NN
times	IN
:	NN
selling	NN
call	IN
options	NN
on	NN
stocks	IN
the	NN
investor	NN
owns	IN
.	NN

A	NN
call	IN
option	NN
is	NN
similar	IN
to	NN
a	NN
put	IN
,	NN
except	NN
that	IN
it	NN
gives	NN
its	IN
owner	NN
the	NN
right	IN
to	NN
buy	NN
shares	IN
at	NN
a	NN
stated	IN
price	NN
until	NN
expiration	IN
.	NN

Selling	NN
a	IN
call	NN
option	NN
gives	IN
an	NN
investor	NN
a	IN
small	NN
buffer	NN
against	IN
a	NN
stock-market	NN
decline	NN
.	IN

That	NN
's	IN
because	NN
it	NN
reduces	IN
the	NN
cost	NN
of	IN

not	NN
that	IN
the	NN
resistance	NN
has	IN
failed	NN

says	IN
the	NN

was	IN
to	NN
make	NN
his	IN
point	NN
that	NN
Americans	IN
have	NN
rights	NN
as	IN
individuals	NN
,	NN
not	IN
as	NN
members	NN

certain	NN

His	NN

criticized	NN
the	NN
``	NN

Mr.	IN

The	NN
three	IN

things	IN
to	NN
understand	NN
about	NN

is	NN
that	IN

a	IN
black	NN

intellectual	IN
--	NN
a	NN
triple	IN
threat	NN
to	NN

teaches	IN

will	IN
remain	NN
a	NN

has	NN
spent	IN

that	IN

rights	IN

He	NN
last	IN
made	NN
waves	NN
when	IN
he	NN
dared	NN
to	IN
defend	NN
an	NN
Indian	NN
girl	IN

had	NN
been	IN
adopted	NN
by	NN
non-Indian	IN
parents	NN
off	NN
her	IN
reservation	NN

Mr.	NN
Allen	IN
quickly	NN
ran	NN
up	IN
against	NN
the	NN
liberal	NN
establishment	IN
again	NN
,	NN
which	IN
somehow	NN
elevated	NN
the	IN
vague	NN
concept	NN
of	IN
``	NN
Indian	NN
rights	IN
''	NN
above	NN
the	IN
rights	NN
of	NN
individual	IN

There	NN
is	IN
a	NN
huge	NN
divide	IN
between	NN
Mr.	NN

's	IN
we're-all-in-this-together	NN
view	NN
and	IN
the	NN
divisive	NN
litigation	IN
approach	NN
of	NN
the	IN
civil	NN
rights	NN
groups	IN
.	NN

Indeed	NN
,	IN
the	NN
gap	NN
is	IN
so	NN
large	NN
that	IN
Mr.	NN
Allen	NN
's	NN
critics	IN
refuse	NN
to	NN
engage	IN
the	NN
debate	NN

Their	NN
ridicule	IN

Their	NN
effort	IN

Yet	NN
it	IN

also	NN
axiomatic	IN
that	NN
the	NN

Beginning	NN
in	IN
the	NN
early	NN
19th	IN
century	NN
,	NN
with	IN
U.S.	NN
v.	NN
Hudson	NN
and	IN

,	NN
the	IN
Supreme	NN

has	IN
repeatedly	NN
held	NN
that	IN

judicial	NN
power	IN
to	NN
declare	NN
conduct	IN
to	NN
be	NN
against	IN
the	NN
public	NN
interest	IN
and	NN
hence	NN
criminal	IN
,	NN
while	NN
well	IN
established	NN
in	NN
British	IN

would	IN
usurp	NN
legislative	NN
authority	IN
under	NN
the	NN
doctrine	IN
of	NN
separation	NN
of	IN
powers	NN

That	NN
's	IN
the	NN
conventional	NN
theory	IN

In	NN
practice	IN

however	NN
,	IN
the	NN
line	NN
between	IN

of	IN
the	NN
criminal	NN
law	IN
long	NN

began	IN
to	NN
blur	NN

In	NN
particular	IN
,	NN
a	NN
common	IN
law	NN
of	NN
white-collar	IN
crime	NN
has	NN
developed	IN
with	NN
surprising	NN
rapidity	IN
over	NN
the	NN
past	IN
decade	NN

For	NN
example	IN
,	NN
although	NN
insider	IN

has	NN
long	NN
been	IN
criminal	NN
,	NN
it	IN
has	NN
never	NN
been	IN
statutorily	NN
defined	NN
.	NN

In	NN
1983	IN
,	NN
the	NN
Supreme	IN
Court	NN
tried	NN
to	NN
supply	IN
a	NN
workable	NN
definition	IN
in	NN
the	NN
Dirks	IN
v.	NN
SEC	NN
decision	NN
,	IN
which	NN
found	NN
that	IN
liability	NN
depended	NN
on	IN
whether	NN
the	NN
tipper	IN
had	NN
breached	NN
his	IN
fiduciary	NN
duty	NN
to	IN
the	NN
corporation	NN
in	IN

''	NN
and	IN
whether	NN
the	NN
tippee	IN
knew	NN

recklessly	IN
disregarded	NN
this	NN
fact	IN

Gradually	NN
,	IN
however	NN
,	NN
lower	IN
courts	NN
and	NN
prosecutors	IN
have	NN
pushed	NN
this	IN
definition	NN
to	NN
its	IN
breaking	NN
point	NN

Consider	NN
the	IN
facts	NN

the	IN
1989	NN
conviction	NN
of	NN
Robert	IN

Basically	NN
,	IN
Mr.	NN

was	IN

Did	NN
Mr.	IN

did	IN

hear	NN
a	NN

rumor	IN
(	NN
which	NN

The	NN

purposes	NN

A	NN
second	IN
illustration	NN
is	NN
supplied	IN
by	NN
the	NN
recent	IN
guilty	NN
plea	NN
entered	NN
by	IN
Robert	NN
Freeman	NN
,	IN
formerly	NN
head	NN
of	IN
arbitrage	NN
at	NN
Goldman	IN
,	NN
Sachs	NN
&	IN
Co	NN
.	NN

Essentially	NN
,	IN
Mr.	NN
Freeman	NN
had	IN
invested	NN
heavily	NN
in	NN
the	IN
Beatrice	NN
leveraged	NN
buy-out	NN
,	IN
when	NN
he	NN
was	IN
told	NN
by	NN
another	IN
prominent	NN

,	IN
Bernard	NN
``	NN
Bunny	IN
''	NN
Lasker	NN
,	IN
that	NN
the	NN
deal	IN
was	NN
in	NN
trouble	IN
.	NN

After	NN
placing	IN
orders	NN
to	NN
sell	IN
,	NN
Mr.	NN
Freeman	NN
called	IN
Martin	NN
Siegel	NN
,	IN
an	NN
investment	NN
banker	NN
at	IN
Kidder	NN
,	NN
Peabody	IN
&	NN
Co.	NN
,	IN
who	NN
was	NN
advising	IN
on	NN
the	NN
deal	IN
,	NN
to	NN
confirm	IN
these	NN
rumors	NN
.	NN

Mr.	NN
Siegel	IN
asked	NN
Mr.	NN
Freeman	NN
who	IN
his	NN
source	NN
was	IN
and	NN
,	NN
on	IN
hearing	NN
that	NN
it	IN
was	NN
Bunny	NN
Lasker	IN
,	NN
responded	NN
:	IN
``	NN
Well	NN
,	IN
your	NN
bunny	NN
has	IN
a	NN
good	NN
nose	IN
.	NN
''	NN

The	NN
illegal	IN
``	NN
tip	NN
''	IN
of	NN
the	NN
bunny	IN
's	NN
good	NN
nose	IN
was	NN
then	NN
largely	IN
a	NN
confirmation	NN
of	IN
rumors	NN
already	NN
known	IN
to	NN
many	NN
in	IN
the	NN
market	NN
.	NN

Had	NN
the	IN
case	NN
gone	NN
to	IN
trial	NN
the	NN
same	IN
issues	NN
would	NN
have	IN
surfaced	NN
:	NN

Was	NN
there	IN
a	NN
fiduciary	NN
breach	IN
in	NN
order	NN
to	IN
obtain	NN
personal	NN
gain	NN
?	IN

Did	NN
Mr.	IN
Freeman	NN
have	NN
notice	IN
of	NN
this	NN
?	NN

Finally	NN
,	IN
was	NN
the	NN
information	IN
material	NN
?	NN

Yet	NN
,	IN
all	NN
these	NN
issues	IN
are	NN
subsidiary	NN
to	NN
a	IN
more	NN
central	NN
issue	IN
:	NN
Who	NN
is	IN
and	NN
who	NN
should	IN
be	NN
making	NN
the	IN
criminal	NN
law	NN
here	IN
?	NN

It	NN
is	IN
not	NN
my	NN
contention	IN
that	NN
either	NN
Mr.	NN
Chestman	IN
or	NN
Mr.	NN
Freeman	IN
was	NN
an	NN
innocent	IN
victim	NN
of	NN
prosecutorial	IN
overzealousness	NN
.	NN

Arguably	NN
,	IN
both	NN
were	NN
on	IN
notice	NN
that	NN
their	IN
behavior	NN
was	NN
at	NN
least	IN
risky	NN
.	NN

But	NN
even	IN
if	NN
they	NN
behaved	IN
recklessly	NN
,	NN
reasons	NN
still	IN
exist	NN
to	NN
fear	IN
and	NN
resist	NN
this	IN
steady	NN
process	NN
of	IN
case-by-case	NN
judicial	NN
extension	IN
of	NN
the	NN
law	IN
of	NN
insider	NN
trading	IN
.	NN

Courts	NN
and	IN
legislatures	NN
make	NN
decisions	IN
in	NN
very	NN
different	NN
ways	IN
and	NN
are	NN
each	IN
susceptible	NN
to	NN
very	IN
different	NN
kinds	NN
of	IN
errors	NN
.	NN

After-the-fact	NN
judicial	IN
examination	NN
of	NN
an	IN
actor	NN
's	NN
conduct	IN
has	NN
always	NN
been	IN
the	NN
common	NN
law	IN
's	NN
method	NN
.	NN

When	NN
only	IN
civil	NN
liability	NN
is	IN
involved	NN
,	NN
this	IN
method	NN
has	NN
the	IN
undeniable	NN
strengths	NN
of	IN
factual	NN
specificity	NN
and	IN
avoidance	NN
of	NN
overgeneralization	IN
.	NN

Still	NN
,	IN
case-by-case	NN
retrospective	NN
decision	IN
making	NN
of	NN
this	IN
sort	NN
is	NN
vulnerable	IN
to	NN
the	NN
tunnel	IN
vision	NN
caused	NN
by	IN
a	NN
fixation	NN
on	IN
ad	NN
hoc	NN
(	IN
and	NN
usually	NN
sleazy	IN
)	NN
examples	NN
.	NN

When	NN
a	IN
court	NN
decides	NN
that	IN
a	NN
particular	NN
actor	IN
's	NN
conduct	NN
was	NN
culpable	IN
and	NN
so	NN
extends	IN
the	NN
definition	NN
of	IN
insider	NN
trading	NN
to	IN
reach	NN
this	NN
conduct	IN
,	NN
it	NN
does	IN
not	NN
see	NN
the	IN
potentially	NN
enormous	NN
number	IN
of	NN
other	NN
cases	IN
that	NN
will	NN
be	IN
covered	NN
by	NN
the	IN
expanded	NN
rule	NN
.	NN

Thus	NN
,	IN
a	NN
court	NN
is	IN
poorly	NN
positioned	NN
to	IN
make	NN
judgments	NN
about	NN
the	IN
social	NN
utility	NN
of	IN
the	NN
expanded	NN
rule	IN

For	NN
example	IN

in	NN
focusing	IN
on	NN
Mr.	NN
Freeman	NN
's	IN
attempt	NN
to	NN
gain	IN
nonpublic	NN
information	NN
about	IN

think	NN
about	NN
the	IN

side	NN
of	IN
the	NN
coin	NN
:	IN
What	NN
if	NN
the	IN
rumor	NN
had	NN
been	IN
false	NN
?	NN

Can	NN
a	IN
security	NN
analyst	NN
call	IN
an	NN
investment	NN
banker	NN
to	IN
make	NN
certain	NN
that	IN
a	NN
seemingly	NN
improbable	IN
rumor	NN
is	NN
in	IN
fact	NN
false	NN
?	NN

In	NN
the	IN
past	NN
,	NN
not	IN
only	NN
would	NN
reputable	NN
professionals	IN
have	NN
rushed	NN
to	IN
check	NN
out	NN
such	IN
rumors	NN
with	NN
the	IN
company	NN
,	NN
but	IN
companies	NN
listed	NN
on	IN
the	NN
major	NN
stock	IN

encouraged	IN
by	NN
the	NN
exchanges	IN
to	NN
respond	NN
openly	IN
to	NN
such	NN
inquiries	IN
from	NN
securities	NN
analysts	NN
.	IN

Today	NN
,	IN
after	NN
Mr.	NN
Freeman	IN
's	NN
plea	NN
,	NN
there	IN
is	NN
an	NN
uncertainty	IN
that	NN
is	NN
both	IN
unfair	NN
and	NN
inefficient	IN
.	NN

In	NN
this	IN

too	NN
did	IN
some	NN

interest	IN

The	NN
reason	IN

ad	NN

say	NN

is	IN
that	NN
the	NN

has	NN
some	NN

during	IN

Perhaps	NN
the	IN

of	NN
those	IN
factors	NN
is	NN

When	NN
ad	IN
dollars	NN

tight	IN

the	NN
high	IN

a	IN

To	NN
combat	IN
that	NN
problem	NN
,	IN
National	NN
Geographic	NN
,	NN
like	IN
other	NN

began	NN

the	IN

was	NN

up	IN

its	NN

Dual	NN

gives	NN
an	NN

the	NN
right	NN
to	IN
trade	NN
both	NN
for	IN

The	NN
issue	IN
exploded	NN
this	NN
year	IN
after	NN
a	NN
Federal	IN
Bureau	NN
of	NN
Investigation	IN
operation	NN
led	NN
to	IN
charges	NN

abuses	NN
at	IN
the	NN
Chicago	NN
Board	IN

While	NN
not	IN

the	NN

dual	NN

became	NN
a	NN
focus	IN
of	NN
attempts	NN
to	IN
tighten	NN
industry	NN

Critics	NN
contend	IN
that	NN

their	NN

Traders	NN
are	IN
likely	NN
to	NN
oppose	IN
such	NN
restrictions	NN
because	IN
dual	NN
trading	NN
provides	IN
a	NN
way	NN
to	IN
make	NN
money	NN
in	IN
slower	NN
markets	NN
where	IN
there	NN
is	NN
a	IN
shortage	NN

The	NN
exchanges	IN
contend	NN
that	NN
dual	IN
trading	NN
improves	NN
liquidity	IN
in	NN
the	NN
markets	NN
because	IN
traders	NN
can	NN
buy	IN

sell	NN
even	IN
when	NN
they	NN
do	IN
n't	NN
have	NN
a	IN

The	NN

liquidity	NN
becomes	IN

problem	IN

such	NN
as	NN
those	IN
with	NN
a	NN
long	IN

The	NN

may	NN
take	NN
those	IN
arguments	NN
into	NN
account	IN
by	NN
allowing	NN
exceptions	NN

The	NN

this	NN

about	IN

it	IN

To	NN
keep	IN

we	IN
invent	NN

But	NN
we	IN
still	NN

Which	NN
brings	IN
up	NN
the	NN
worst	IN
and	NN
meanest	NN
ghost	NN
of	IN
all	NN
--	NN
the	IN
ghost	NN
of	NN
the	NN
shah	IN
of	NN
Iran	NN
.	NN

When	NN
the	IN
shah	NN
died	NN
,	IN
President	NN
Carter	NN
was	NN
so	IN
scared	NN
that	NN
the	IN
shah	NN
's	NN
ghost	IN
would	NN
blame	NN
him	IN
for	NN
shoving	NN
him	IN
out	NN
to	NN
make	IN
way	NN
for	NN
the	IN
ayatollah	NN
that	NN
he	IN
declared	NN
the	NN
Carter	IN
Doctrine	NN
.	NN

Mr.	NN
Carter	IN
said	NN
he	NN
would	IN
go	NN
to	NN
war	NN
to	IN
stop	NN
anyone	NN
from	IN
trying	NN
to	NN
grab	IN
Iran	NN
.	NN

But	NN
that	IN
ghost	NN
would	NN
n't	IN
settle	NN
for	NN
words	IN
,	NN
he	NN
wanted	NN
money	IN
and	NN
people	NN
--	IN
lots	NN
.	NN

So	NN
Mr.	IN
Carter	NN
formed	NN
three	IN
new	NN
Army	NN
divisions	NN
and	IN
gave	NN
them	NN
to	IN
a	NN
new	NN
bureaucracy	IN
in	NN
Tampa	NN
called	IN
the	NN
Rapid	NN
Deployment	IN
Force	NN
.	NN

But	NN
that	IN
ghost	NN
was	NN
n't	IN
fooled	NN
;	NN
he	NN
knew	IN
the	NN
RDF	NN
was	IN
neither	NN
rapid	NN
nor	IN
deployable	NN
nor	NN
a	IN
force	NN
--	NN
even	IN
though	NN
it	NN
cost	IN
$	NN
8	NN
billion	IN
or	NN
$	NN
10	IN
billion	NN
a	NN
year	IN
.	NN

After	NN
Mr.	IN
Carter	NN
was	NN
defeated	IN
in	NN
1980	NN
,	NN
the	IN
shah	NN
's	NN
ghost	IN
claimed	NN
the	NN
credit	IN
and	NN
then	NN
went	IN
after	NN
President	NN
Reagan	IN
and	NN
Cap	NN
Weinberger	IN
.	NN

I	NN
saw	IN
what	NN
he	NN
did	IN
to	NN
them	NN
firsthand	IN
.	NN

It	NN
made	IN
my	NN
shoelaces	NN
dance	IN
with	NN
terror	NN

Why	NN
,	IN
he	NN
used	NN
to	IN
lay	NN
in	NN
wait	NN
for	IN
Cap	NN
;	NN
suddenly	IN
he	NN
'd	NN
leap	IN
from	NN
behind	NN
some	IN
statue	NN
of	NN
Marshall	IN
onto	NN
Cap	NN
's	IN
chest	NN
and	NN
grab	IN
him	NN
by	NN
the	IN
throat	NN
and	NN
choke	IN
him	NN
till	NN
he	IN
coughed	NN
up	NN
an	IN
additional	NN
$	NN
2	IN
billion	NN
or	NN
so	IN
.	NN

Cap	NN
added	IN
four	NN
more	NN
divisions	IN
to	NN
the	NN
Army	IN
,	NN
two	NN
active	NN
and	IN
two	NN

,	IN
C-17	NN
and	NN
a	IN
thousand	NN
tactical	NN
aircraft	IN
to	NN
the	NN
Air	IN
Force	NN
.	NN

He	NN
bought	IN
$	NN
4	NN

in	NN
prepositioning	NN
ships	IN
and	NN
$	NN
7	IN
billion	NN
in	NN
ammo	IN

fill	NN
them	NN

parked	NN
them	IN

a	NN

at	NN
Diego	IN
Garcia	NN
in	NN
the	IN
middle	NN
of	NN
the	IN

.	NN

He	NN
dedicated	IN
all	NN
these	NN
new	IN
forces	NN
to	NN
the	IN
Persian	NN
Gulf	NN
.	NN

One	NN
night	IN
both	NN
Marshall	NN
's	IN
ghost	NN
and	NN
the	IN
shah	NN
's	NN
ghost	IN
together	NN
caught	NN
Cap	IN
and	NN
threw	NN
him	IN
to	NN
the	NN
ground	IN
.	NN

Before	NN
they	IN
let	NN
him	NN
go	IN
he	NN
added	NN
a	IN
thousand	NN
bureaucrats	NN
to	NN
the	IN
RDF	NN
in	NN
Tampa	IN
and	NN
renamed	NN
it	IN
Central	NN
Command	NN
.	NN

He	NN
gave	IN
those	NN
bureaucrats	NN
charge	IN
of	NN
all	NN
naval	IN
operations	NN
in	NN
the	IN
Persian	NN
Gulf	NN
and	IN
Indian	NN

.	NN

Marshall	NN
figured	IN
it	NN
would	NN
be	IN
good	NN
training	NN
for	IN
those	NN
soldiers	NN
--	NN
someday	IN
maybe	NN
they	NN
would	IN
get	NN
the	NN
whole	IN
Navy	NN
.	NN

They	NN
had	IN
fun	NN
moving	NN
the	IN
carriers	NN
around	NN
,	IN
but	NN
it	NN
turned	NN
out	IN
that	NN
they	NN
had	IN
forgotten	NN
all	NN
about	IN
mine	NN
sweepers	NN
.	NN

But	NN
the	IN
shah	NN
still	NN
kept	IN
leaping	NN
out	NN
at	NN
Cap	IN
,	NN
so	NN
Cap	IN
bought	NN
a	NN
hundred	NN
merchant	IN
ships	NN
more	NN
and	IN
$	NN
7	NN
billion	IN
of	NN
loading	NN
barges	IN
,	NN
ramps	NN
,	IN

,	NN
in	IN
order	NN
that	NN
those	IN
seven	NN
new	NN
Army	IN
divisions	NN
and	NN
three	IN
Marine	NN
brigades	NN
could	IN
unload	NN
from	NN
all	IN
those	NN
new	NN
ships	IN
and	NN
aircraft	NN
and	IN
go	NN
to	NN
war	IN
in	NN
the	NN
Zagros	IN
mountains	NN
.	NN

Then	NN
suddenly	IN
Ike	NN
's	NN
ghost	IN
came	NN
to	NN
visit	IN
and	NN
said	NN
,	NN
``	IN
What	NN

Lucky	NN
for	IN

Ike	IN
was	NN

soon	IN
went	NN
away	NN

while	NN
the	NN

--	NN
he	NN
kept	IN
coming	NN
back	NN

So	NN
the	IN
U.S.	NN
found	NN
itself	IN
paying	NN
about	NN

We	NN
had	IN
great	NN
success	NN
in	IN

then	IN
it	NN
turned	NN
out	IN
that	NN
President	NN
Siad	NN

was	NN
not	NN
at	IN
all	NN
a	NN
nice	IN

the	IN

pointed	NN
out	IN
that	NN
the	NN

he	NN
promised	NN
us	IN
in	NN
Berbera	NN
had	IN
silted	NN
up	NN
about	IN

Berbera	NN
was	NN
the	IN

we	IN
stay	NN

All	NN
these	IN

about	NN
him	IN

the	IN

some	NN
